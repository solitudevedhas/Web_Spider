Even team up for new 4-player co-op fun in Salmon Run!\\nTwo years have passed since the original Splatoon™ game was released, and two years have also passed in Inkopolis! So expect a fresh wave of fashion, not to mention new weapons and gear. Dual wield the new Splat Dualies or stick to mainstays like chargers and rollers, which have been remixed with new strategic possibilities. As always, Turf War is the favored sport among Inklings, but they also dig ranked battles, taking down Octarians in a robust single-player campaign, and battling enemy Salmonids in one dangerous part-time job! No matter which way you play, splat at home or on-the-go with Nintendo Switch. Staying fresh never felt so good.\\n\\nTurf War - Team up in fierce 4-on-4 multiplayer battles* to see which team can cover the most turf with ink\\nSalmon Run – 2-4 players* can team up for co-op fun and defeat waves of enemy Salmonids.\\nNew weapons – Dual wield the new Splat Dualies and avoid getting splatted with the new Dodge Roll move. Mainstays like the Splat Roller and Splat Charger have been remixed to include new gameplay mechanics, and all special weapons are brand-new.\\nLocal and Online Multiplayer - In a first for the series, compete in local multiplayer Turf War battles*, whether in TV mode or on-the-go in handheld or tabletop modes. Online battles also make a return**\\nNew ways to play – Play with the Joy-Con™ controllers or the Nintendo Switch™ Pro Controller (sold separately), both of which support motion controls for better aiming\\nFresh Updates - Similar to the Splatoon™ game for the Wii U™ console, updates will roll out post-launch, adding new content and in-game events.\\nSmart Device Support** - An upcoming smart-device application for the Nintendo Switch system will allow players to set play appointments with friends and teammates, as well as voice chat with friends during play sessions.\\nLAN Play - Up to 10 docked systems – eight players and two spectators – can connect via wired LAN (additional accessories required; sold separately). This feature allows players to create local Private Battle tournaments without the need for an internet connection. Local wireless play is perfect for your regular gaming get-togethers, but LAN Play is where it's at when you want to organize a serious tournament.\\nCustomize – Change your Inkling's style with different weapons, headgear, clothes, and shoes. Gear isn't just aesthetic; it offers different boosts in battles.\\namiibo - Compatible with all Splatoon™ series amiibo™ figures.

Use captured cohorts such as enemies, objects, and animals to progress through the game and uncover loads of hidden collectibles. And if you feel like playing with a friend, just pass them a Joy-Con™ controller! Player 1 controls Mario while Player 2 controls Cappy.

Even team up for new 4-player co-op fun in Salmon Run!\\nTwo years have passed since the original Splatoon™ game was released, and two years have also passed in Inkopolis! So expect a fresh wave of fashion, not to mention new weapons and gear. Dual wield the new Splat Dualies or stick to mainstays like chargers and rollers, which have been remixed with new strategic possibilities. As always, Turf War is the favored sport among Inklings, but they also dig ranked battles, taking down Octarians in a robust single-player campaign, and battling enemy Salmonids in one dangerous part-time job! No matter which way you play, splat at home or on-the-go with Nintendo Switch. Staying fresh never felt so good.\\n\\nTurf War - Team up in fierce 4-on-4 multiplayer battles* to see which team can cover the most turf with ink\\nSalmon Run – 2-4 players* can team up for co-op fun and defeat waves of enemy Salmonids.\\nNew weapons – Dual wield the new Splat Dualies and avoid getting splatted with the new Dodge Roll move. Mainstays like the Splat Roller and Splat Charger have been remixed to include new gameplay mechanics, and all special weapons are brand-new.\\nLocal and Online Multiplayer - In a first for the series, compete in local multiplayer Turf War battles*, whether in TV mode or on-the-go in handheld or tabletop modes. Online battles also make a return**\\nNew ways to play – Play with the Joy-Con™ controllers or the Nintendo Switch™ Pro Controller (sold separately), both of which support motion controls for better aiming\\nFresh Updates - Similar to the Splatoon™ game for the Wii U™ console, updates will roll out post-launch, adding new content and in-game events.\\nSmart Device Support** - An upcoming smart-device application for the Nintendo Switch system will allow players to set play appointments with friends and teammates, as well as voice chat with friends during play sessions.\\nLAN Play - Up to 10 docked systems – eight players and two spectators – can connect via wired LAN (additional accessories required; sold separately). This feature allows players to create local Private Battle tournaments without the need for an internet connection. Local wireless play is perfect for your regular gaming get-togethers, but LAN Play is where it's at when you want to organize a serious tournament.\\nCustomize – Change your Inkling's style with different weapons, headgear, clothes, and shoes. Gear isn't just aesthetic; it offers different boosts in battles.\\namiibo - Compatible with all Splatoon™ series amiibo™ figures. By tapping these amiibo, the figure's character will appear in the game and befriend players.

       "     'description': \"Forget everything you know about The Legend of Zelda games. Step into a world of discovery, exploration, and adventure in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, a boundary-breaking new game in the acclaimed series. Travel across vast fields, through forests, and to mountain peaks as you discover what has become of the kingdom of Hyrule In this stunning Open-Air Adventure. Now on Nintendo Switch, your journey is freer and more open than ever. Take your system anywhere, and adventure as Link any way you like.\\nFeatures:\\n\\nExplore the wilds of Hyrule any way you like—anytime, anywhere! - Climb up towers and mountain peaks in search of new destinations, then set your own path to get there and plunge into the wilderness. Along the way, you'll battle towering enemies, hunt wild beasts and gather ingredients for the food and elixirs you'll make to sustain you on your journey. With Nintendo Switch, you can literally take your journey anywhere.\\nMore than 100 Shrines of Trials to discover and explore - Shrines dot the landscape, waiting to be discovered in any order you want. Search for them in various ways, and solve a variety of puzzles inside. The tasks you must perform in each Shrine varies, and you'll never expect the challenges you'll face until you enter. Some will involve realistic physics, and some will require you to harness the power of nature, including electricity, wind, fire, and more. Work your way through the traps and devices inside, utilizing your runes and think outside the box to earn special items and other rewards that will help you on your adventure.\\nBe prepared and properly equipped – With an entire world waiting to be explored, you'll need a variety of outfits and gear to reach every corner. You may need to bundle up with warmer clothes or change into something better suited to the desert heat. Some clothing even has special effects that, for example, can make you faster or stealthier.\\nBattling enemies requires strategy – The world is inhabited with enemies of all shapes and sizes. Each one has its own attack method and weaponry, so you must think quickly and develop the right strategies to defeat them.\\namiibo compatibility – The Wolf Link amiibo from Twilight Princess HD, the Zelda 30th Anniversary series amiibo, and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild series amiibo are all compatible with this game. Tap the Wolf Link amiibo (sold separately) to make Wolf Link appear in the game. Wolf Link will attack enemies on his own and help you find items you’re searching for. Tap a Zelda 30th Anniversary series amiibo to receive helpful in-game items or even a treasure chest!\",\n",

       "     'description': 'The player assumes the role of a Small Plastic Soldier and must scavenge the environment for resources in order to construct turrets, build defences and protect the HYPER-CORE. The environment is much larger than the player making every normal household item an obstacle. The HYPER-CORE is powered by a battery and the player must explore the environment to find one, ensuring the HYPER-CORE is always operational. Nostalgic waves of weaponised toys attack from different directions and locations. They will stop at nothing to destroy the HYPER-CORE, the players and their defences. The player progresses by completing each level, earning XP and unlocking unique skins and characters, giving the opportunity to customise their action figure to their liking. The gameplay evokes nostalgic memories from those who grew up in the 80ies and the 90ies, and at the same time makes it accessible for new audiences to pick up and play the game.',\n",

After all, there’s only one spot at the top and you just found a chainsaw…\\nSometimes the enemy is next to you on the couch.\\nGather your best friends, or enemies (doesn’t matter, you’ll turn on each other either way), and take down the rampaging hordes of monsters! Beat your “allies” to the treasure and gear up with legendary weapons such as the Rat-on-a-Stick, a Scepter that sends love or a Flare Gun.. Fast-playing and silly, Munchkin: Quacked Quest can reduce any roleplaying group to hysteria. And, while they're laughing, you can be the first to grab the ducks.\\n&nbsp;\\n...HEY, THAT’S MY DUCK!&nbsp;\\nNot afraid of chickens and trolls? Do you enjoy smashing random objects for loot? Are you eager to vanquish epic bosses and betray your friends? In either the solo or local multiplayer mode, you race through randomly generated dungeons and overcome increasingly bizarre challenges. Choose from four different races and classes and unleash their special skills at the right moment to gain an advantage over your opponents. The mix between accessible, yet rich, gameplay and a leveling race offers intense and skill-based brawling action.&nbsp;\\n&nbsp;\\n...I SAID DROP THE DUCK, BOB!\\nTrust the Wight Brothers and their Fabulous Dungeonarium Machine (FDM™©) to generate unique dungeons filled with deadly traps, dangerous enemies and magnificent ducks. Every adventure will be enhanced by random modifiers. The more victories you claim, the more possibilities will be added to your game.&nbsp;&nbsp;\\n&nbsp;\\nMain gameplay features:\\n• Play solo or with up to four players in couch mode and adventure through deadly dungeons where enemies lurk. Be careful, sometimes the most dangerous enemy is sitting right next to you…\\n• Be the fastest, the most cunning, or the most effective at accomplishing the crazy objectives of each dungeon: capture ducks, slay monsters, defeat bosses, while throwing your friends/foes into pits and smashing furniture… everything you wish you could have done at your cousin’s wedding.\\n• Four races and four classes available: become a fashionable Orc Priest, a grumpy Dwarf Wizard, or dozens of other combinations. (Management will deny any liability in case of a botched spell or missing limb.)\\n• More than 20 weapons to wield for hitting, cutting, shooting, hugging, burning, smashing or knocking down more than 15 different enemies—or friends. Just in case, you know...they get in your way. And if you want to hit harder, run faster, or be even more annoying to the other players, there are nine almost-lethal items to choose from.&nbsp;\\n• Randomly generated dungeons for infinite replay value! You will never need to purchase another game. Ever. #MarketingDPTApproves\\n• Customized experience: choose player mode and game duration and let the back-stabbing, loot-grabbing, slaying, and betraying commence!\\nHA HA! THE DUCK IS MINE! MINE!!!\",\n",

That's the essence of OFDP2, the world's fastest brawler. It features the original OFDP's unique two-button mechanics which we've spent the last five years perfecting. Speed and precision are key in this whirlwind fighting frenzy, as players maintain control over the 26 different unlockable skills, frenetic gameplay, and classic kung fu-inspired animations.&nbsp;&nbsp;\\n&nbsp;\\nATTACK LEFT or ATTACK RIGHT&nbsp; &nbsp;\\n&nbsp;\\nWe want to show that a fighting game can be complex without cumbersome button combinations. Once players complete the tutorial levels and learn the basics, they'll see that this is the most intense two-button game ever made.&nbsp;&nbsp;\\nWith 1000 different animations available, literally, anything is possible—particularly when players unlock each of the 26 available skills. Having these skills available simultaneously is a major design challenge that encompasses the core of what OFDP2 is trying to achieve. Seeing the game with all 26 skills is a spectacle unique to OFDP2.&nbsp;&nbsp;\\n\\nWe built this game as a palette cleanser between other games in your library. It was designed to deliver a quick hit of adrenalin as fast as possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;\",\n",

Players take on the role of Sakuna, a spoiled harvest goddess banished to a dangerous island with a group of outcast humans. As she explores the beautiful, forbidding environments of the island, she will also find a home in a mountain village, proving herself worthy of her title by harvesting rice and bettering the lives of humans. In addition to being a fresh take on Japanese mythology and a love letter to action games, Sakuna: Of Rice and Ruin is an ode to rice and an engrossing simulation of the craft behind the agriculture.',\n",

       "     'description': \"Where the Water Tastes Like Wine is a Narrative-Adventure game about traveling, sharing stories, and surviving manifest destiny. Featuring gorgeous hand-drawn illustrations, Where the Water Tastes Like Wine combines 2D visuals with a 3D overworld US map.\\nPlayers wander across a folkloric Depression era United States at their own pace, meeting strangers with their own stories to tell. Through these interactions, players will be able to collect unique stories which can then be re-told to unlock new interactions. In this way the in-game stories themselves act as a currency to progress through the game, and it’s up to the player to pair the right story with the unique needs of each of the characters that you will encounter throughout your travels. Only through these right pairings will characters reveal their true selves, and bestow you with the most powerful stories, the true ones which reveal something about their own lives. In Where The Water Tastes Like Wine, stories organically take on a life of their own as they grow larger and transform as they're told- and re-told.\",\n",

This 2D sidescrolling exploration platformer follows the adventure of Erina, whose humdrum life as a regular rabbit is turned upside-down when she finds herself in an unknown world and turned into a human (with rabbit ears)!\\nAlong the way she meets the cheerful pink-haired fairy, Ribbon, who mysteriously chooses to stay by Erina’s side.\\nThese unwitting heroes embark together on their quest to restore Erina’s life to normalcy, but who knows what troubles lurk, waiting for them…\\n&nbsp;\\n●Explore!

Ribbon the fairy is the ranged attacker who follows Erina’s lead, indirectly controlled by the player.\\nErina may be a little rabbit that was turned into a human, but that doesn’t stop her from being capable of some pretty neat moves.\\nBoth Erina and Ribbon’s abilities can be improved by learning new skills and attacks through collecting items and upgrades that are spread throughout the world.\\nWhat trinkets and skills to pick up is up to the player; dare you challenge hard mode without any items?\\n&nbsp;\\n●Features\\n&nbsp;\\n– Retro exploration platformer featuring a bunny girl.\\n– 4+n difficulty settings for all types of players.\\n– 9+ main areas and 20+ sub-areas to explore.\\n– Bunny.\\n– Over 60 items and upgrades.\\n– Over 20 fully illustrated characters with cutscene illustrations.\\n– 40+ boss battles, 1000+ attack patterns with Boss Rush Mode to fight some or all of them in a row.\\n– Post game story and content with speedrun mode which takes out every section of the game where the player cannot control the main character.\\n– Over 50+ pieces from an original soundtrack.\\n– English, Chinese and Japanese support.\\n– Bunny.\",\n",

       "     'description': 'How many steps does it take to change a light bulb? If your answer is 10 or more, then you are ready for &quot;Contraptions&quot; - a game where the goal is to fix whacky contraptions that perform simple tasks in indirect and convoluted ways, Rube Goldberg style.\\nUse camels as trampolines, champagne bottles as cannons, balloons to lift objects, fireworks wheels to drive conveyor belts, magnets to attract metal objects, and many more gadgets to solve the puzzles and clear the levels.\\n&nbsp;\\nFeatures\\n+ Solve over 100 wacky puzzles across 5 different worlds.\\n+ Create an unlimited number of your own levels and challenge a friend to try to beat it.\\n+ Use a plethora of goofy gadgets from scissors to washing-line pegs.\\n+ Complete the levels in multiple ways...get as bonkers and creative as you like.\\n&nbsp;\\nGameplay\\nOn every level there are a number of objects and monsters...The goal is to rid the level of the monsters.\\nThis can be achieved in different ways...The objects are affected by the laws of physics and play a key part in solving the puzzle. The objects form a “contraption” which are placed in such a way, which creates a chain reaction that will wipe out all monsters. The catch is that the contraption is broken - some objects are not in the right place. Your goal is to fix the contraption. You do this, by repositioning, flipping, or connecting the different objects.\\nWhen the level starts “time is frozen”, gravity doesn’t affect the objects and all machines or gadgets are not running. During this time you can move things around, connect things, flip things, in order to make the chain reaction work. Once you are done, you set things in motion (unfreeze time) by pressing the Play button and watch things play out.\\nIf you did everything correctly the chain reaction will wipe out all monsters and you will progress to the next level. If your solution is not correct, you can pause the contraption and fiddle with the objects again.\\n&nbsp;\\nGadgets\\nSome of the gadgets are activated by igniting them, other by touching, pushing or pulling them. Some gadgets work on their own, while other gadgets must be connected together to function. For example in order for the conveyor belt to turn, it must be connected to an active engine, using a belt. Likewise in order for the laser gun to fire a laser, the trigger must be connected with a rope, to a moving object, like a car.\\n&nbsp;\\nObjectives\\nThere dozens of ways you can rid the levels of the monsters. It all depends on what objects are you presented with. The simplest way is if the monster is pushed off the edge of a platform and falls off the screen. Other ways include cutting a rope holding a heavy object, which will smash the monster; pulling a rope, connected to a laser gun; igniting the engine of a rocket with a lighter in which the monster is in, etc.\\n&nbsp;\\nThe solution is achieved through chain reactions, Rube Goldberg style. For example: in order to shoot the monster with a laser, you might have to connect a rope to the trigger, the other end to a rocket. You will need to ignite the engine of the rocket, which will pull the rope, which will trigger the laser gun, which will ultimately eliminate the monster. The more you progress through the game, the more complex the new puzzles become.&nbsp;',\n",

But what if they're wrong? The prophecy is old, and words lose their meaning with time...\\nWhen the world is falling apart around you, what will you do? In Mable &amp; The Wood, it's up to you to make that choice. You don't have to kill anyone, but you might kill everyone.\\nWill you banish the darkness, or will you become it?\\n&nbsp;\\nCOMBAT IS MOVEMENT\\nThe way you move is deadly. Dragging a sword that is too heavy to lift, Mable shape-shifts into a fairy and leaves it where she stood. Recall the sword to your hand once again to slice through any enemies in your path.\\nYou can only maintain your non-human form for a limited time, but killing creatures extends your power.\\n&nbsp;\\nHUNT THE GREAT BEASTS AND TAKE THEIR SHAPE\\nDefeat the great beasts to take their shape and transform into a mole, medusa, spider and more...\\nFind and defeat the other bosses to unlock even more shapes!\\n&nbsp;\\nEXPLORE A DYING WORLD\\nThe game takes place in a dark fantasy world, with each area making up part of a large, complex map that's packed full of all kinds of secrets for you to discover.\\nUncover secrets that you can use to find alternative, non-combat routes through the world and discover a different side to the story (and multiple endings!)\\n&nbsp;\\nDISCOVER WHO YOU REALLY ARE\\nDiscover a rich story and define your own role in it. Will you become the saviour everyone's trying to convince you to be, or will your actions lead to the world literally tearing itself apart?\",\n",

This edition includes 9 killers and 10 survivors to choose from and 3 cosmetic packs.\\nSURVIVE TOGETHER… OR NOT - Survivors can either cooperate with the others or be selfish. Your chance of survival will vary depending on whether you work together as a team or if you go at it alone. Will you be able to outwit the Killer and escape their Killing Ground?\\n\\nA FEAST FOR KILLERS - Dead by Daylight draws from all corners of the horror world. As a Killer, you can play as anything from a powerful slasher to terrifying paranormal entities. Familiarize yourself with your killing grounds and master each Killer’s unique power to be able to hunt, catch and sacrifice your victims. This deadly game of cat and mouse also lets you meet some of the most iconic Killers and Survivors from horror franchises.\\n\\nDEEPER AND DEEPER - Each Killer and Survivor has their own deep progression system and plenty of unlockables that can be customized to fit your own personal strategy. Experience, skills and understanding of the environment are key to being able to hunt or outwit the Killer.\\n\\nREAL PEOPLE, REAL FEAR - The unique levels and real human reactions to pure horror make each game session an unexpected scenario. You will never be able to tell how it’s going to turn out. Ambience, music, and chilling environments combine into a terrifying experience. With enough time, you might even discover what’s hiding in The Fog.',\n",

All you need is six minutes, two players, one Nintendo Switch™, half a brain, and ample room for confusion.\\nTalk It Out is a co-operative guessing game with a twist. Pick up your Nintendo Switch™, grab a friend, and start “talking”. You need to figure out what your co-player is seeing. Ask a question, get an answer. Simple enough, right?\\nNot when your choice of questions is… less than co-operative. And the answers seem to make no sense. So choose wisely, and try to read between the lines. Because what is communication without interpretation? Bound to fail, that’s what!\\nWe should probably mention you’re on a timer, too. No pressure.\\n&nbsp;\\nTalk It Out features:\\n- Odd questions and downright rude responses\\n- Short game rounds for quick coffee break fun\\n- 2 additional unlockable item packs\\n- 3 difficulty settings (because who wants to win ALL the time?)\\n- 6 character choices that affect gameplay\\n- A chance to make new friends!\\n- Tons of opportunity for misunderstanding and losing friends!\\n- A cat with underwear on its head for some reason',\n",

But hey, it works.\\n-Unlock special abilities and upgrade basic combo movements with an all-powerful “final blow”-type move.\\n-Evade the cruel and overrated real world with a long single player campaign.&nbsp;\\n-Well, not as long as that one with the guy with the white hair, SURE, but we're an indie studio, dammit!\",\n",

       "     'description': \"Unforgiving and tense, each mission tells a story of two police operatives - John Rimes and Rick Jones, filled with infiltrating gang hideouts, rescuing hostages, making arrests and other life-threatening situations.\\n– The Surrender System allows you to apprehend the suspects without resorting to violence. Fire a warning shot near them or engage them in melee combat - those are just some of the ways you can make them submit.\\n\\n– Issue commands to your fellow cop Rick Jones. Make sure to use him wisely - and who knows, he might save your life in return.&nbsp;\\n\\n– Randomly placed criminals, hostages and evidence make every level run unique. The placement changes every time you restart, leading to new interesting situations and opportunities.\\n\\n– As a law enforcement officer, you will have access to end-of-the-line police equipment, such as under-the-door cameras, door blast charges and many others.\\n\\n– Various types of lawbreakers, from small petty criminals to well organised gangs and terrorists. Each type has not only unique weapons, but different behaviour and shooting skill.\\n\\nComplex Tactical Gameplay: Try not to get spotted, don't waste bullets, regularly check your surroundings and make sure to take criminals down quietly.\\n– All your actions are scored in real time. Playing aggressively won't get you a high enough result to start the next mission - so keep that in mind!\\n\\n– Local Co-op. Complete missions together for better scores and more fun!\",\n",

       "     'description': 'Remothered: Tormented Fathers is the pure and realistic survival horror video game. A game by Darril Arts, directed by Chris Darril, developed by Stormind Games.\\nPsychology plays a huge role within the game: heroes and enemies are atypical and the line between good and evil is blurred. The plot is rich of unpredictable twists, but touching at the same time. The development of the game is similar to that of a film narration, where the player perfectly identifies himself with the character. The soundtrack, composed by Nobuko Toda and Luca Balboni, enhances the terrifying atmosphere of the game.\\n\\nThe story revolves around Rosemary Reed, a fascinating 35-year-old woman, who reaches Richard Felton’s house, in order to investigate on the disappearance of a girl called Celeste. The woman is greeted by Gloria, the nurse who takes care of old Richard. When Dr. Felton understands Rosemary’s true intentions, the dread begins.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\nKEY FEATURES\\nRemothered: Tormented Fathers is the first title of the long-awaited 3rd person game trilogy. A web of lies where murders and obsessions come to life. A revolutionary experience created for survival horror fans.\\n\\n- Many ways to survive - The endless combinations of game dynamics make the experience available to every gamer: stealth, action, strategic, hide ‘n run. Deceive your stalker and block him in another area of the house. Attack your enemy and make your items more powerful. Carefully study the behaviour of your stalker and his path. Don’t get too close to your enemy, act like an unperceivable shadow, hiding yourself from his sight. Or just mix these dynamics together.\\n\\n- Psychological plot - Characters in the story are everyday people that turn themselves into scary monsters.\\n\\n- Movie-like cutscenes - Thanks to his impressive direction, Chris Darril puts into play a story rich of complex life-like characters.\\n&nbsp;\\nAudio clues - Use the soundtrack and the 3D audio sound effects to understand when your stalkers are getting closer.\\n- No health bars - Your body is the only way to understand how you are doing.\\n\\n- Realistic puzzles - Environments and characters have been conceived to be realistic and credible.\\n\\n- Top-notch soundtrack - Nobuko Toda and Luca Balboni wrote the music for the game.\\n\\n- Real-time loading - Explore the mansion without worrying about empty moments or boring loading times.\\n\\n&nbsp;\\nIn addition, the Nintendo Switch™ version of the game presents these extra features:\\n- A free integrated Artbook that players will unlock the first time they finish the game. This Artbook will contain the characters, locations and storyboard sequences’ concept art, collected items during the game, wireframes and 3D models of the mansion and characters.\\n\\n- Controller’s vibration.\\n\\n- Spatialized audio.',\n",

Your reporting team is hacking away in the background as corporate music plays through the loudspeaker. It's time to make decisions. Will you endorse nationalized healthcare, even though your love interest is worried about increased wait times? Will you demonize the new synthetic alcoholic drink, even though your boss stressed they are an important investor? Will you support current government, as tensions grow between the neighboring country?\\nAfter work, you emerge on the streets of Novistan, shaped by the very news you publish. Perhaps you will see more graffiti, angry bums or even a riot? Or perhaps you will turn the nation into peaceful utopia, filled with cameras and drones watching your every step? How will your channel address tragic events about to happen? Will you agree to meet the clandestine group of truthtellers, or stop to watch the Prime Minister's speech?&nbsp;\\n\\nOn the way home you meet with three main characters: Evie, your co-worker and immigrant, worried about her health and growing xenophobic sentiment; your brother Justin, an aspiring comedian struggling with impostor syndrome and social anxiety; finally Rudy, a single father trying to provide for his little girl and keep his store afloat, while a mega-mart opens up next door. Each day provides a glimpse into their life and how the media shapes their beliefs.&nbsp;\\n\\nBut every Headliner deserves to relax at home from the stress of the job. Listen to the radio and unwind on the comfy couch bought with hard-earned cash, as you watch the city burn outside the window. Perhaps splurge on treats to feed your doggo? Adopt a drone? Have your brother over for dinner? Or maybe keep your doors locked, hoarding every penny, as your apartment slowly fills with piles of cash?&nbsp;\\n\\nAfter good night's sleep, it's time to once again face to boss, new articles, a growing sense of responsibility, and.... power.&nbsp;\",\n",

But upon closer inspection it becomes clear that they harbor animosities and deep hidden motives. The more you delve into this secluded island and the twisted family relations on it, the more complicated and unclear the matter becomes.

No regenerating health bars. No conveniently placed ammo drops. It's just you, outnumbered and outgunned, grabbing weapons off fallen enemies to shoot, slice, and maneuver through a hurricane of slow-motion bullets.\\n&nbsp;\\nWith its unique, stylized graphics SUPERHOT finally adds something new and disruptive to the FPS genre. SUPERHOT’s polished, minimalist visual language helps you focus on what's most important – the fluid gameplay and the cinematic beauty of the fight.\\n&nbsp;\\nSUPERHOT features:\\n• Endless Mode – how long can you last against unyielding waves of enemies?\\n• Challenge Mode – take on SUPERHOT with your bare hands, no restarts, timed runs, and more.\\n• Extras – delve further into SUPERHOT with mini-games, ASCII art, and [redacted].\\n&nbsp;\\nThirty months in the making. Thousands of hours put into development and design. From its humble origins in the 7 Day FPS game jam, through a hugely successful Kickstarter campaign to a plethora of awards and nominations from industry experts, SUPERHOT is a labor of love by its independent, dedicated team and thousands of backers from all around the globe.\",\n",

As cybernetic peacekeeper Officer Patricia Wagon, you'll use your platforming skills, puzzle-solving abilities, and special level-altering Siren Helmet to protect the people of Planet Land and smash enemies into the screen! In Mighty Switch Force! and its HD remake, Mighty Switch Force! Hyper Drive Edition, you'll zap foes while “switching” blocks from the foreground to the background (and vice versa) as you track down the delinquent Hooligan Sisters in each stage. Then, in Mighty Switch Force! 2, Officer Wagon trades in her Pellet Gun for a fire hose as she extinguishes a dangerous blaze and rescues would-be victims. Finally, in Mighty Switch Force! Academy, you'll put the trainees through their paces in expansive HD stages with co-op and versus modes for up to four players. The future of lighthearted law enforcement is here!\",\n",

       "     'description': \"Ages ago, the gods contacted several civilizations all around the world. But since then, they remained silent. Now they need to hear our calls.\\nDivine Ascent is a single and local-multiplayer strategy-puzzle game. The goal is to be the first to build towers, and to reach their tops to place temples.\\n\\nSix of the biggest civilizations of the ancient times compete against each other, to be the one taken by the gods to the heavens. To this end, they've elected builders whose sole purpose is to erect monuments as high in the sky as possible.\\n\\nKey Features:\\n\\n&nbsp;\\n&nbsp; &nbsp; Arena (local-multiplayer) and Puzzles (single player) modes\\n&nbsp; &nbsp; Arena is a set of 24 multiplayer levels for two to six players (humans or A.I.)\\n&nbsp; &nbsp; Single player mode contains 30 puzzles with increasing difficulty, plus the final stage which is sort of an Arena level against 5 opponents\\n&nbsp; &nbsp; Special moves\\n&nbsp; &nbsp; Tile-based isometric 3D graphics\\n&nbsp; &nbsp; Each civilization has its own theme and atmospheric background sound design\\n&nbsp;\\nGame mechanics:\\n&nbsp;\\nThe game is turn-based, in a board game style. The goal is to be the first to place three temples. A temple appears when you place a pawn on a tower five pieces high, or three pieces high in puzzle mode.\\n&nbsp;\\nThe player begins by placing his pawn on any square located on the base floor. If there is no such available square, he must place it on the lowest free floor. You must place it again in the same way after making a temple appear.\\n&nbsp;\\nEach turn, the player has two move options:\\n&nbsp;\\n&nbsp; &nbsp; The pawn can be moved orthogonally to another adjacent free square of the board, whether on the same floor, one floor higher, or one floor lower.\\n&nbsp; &nbsp; You can use the piece in the corner of the screen to add it on a free square of the board.\\n&nbsp;\\nSpecial moves:\\n&nbsp;\\n&nbsp; &nbsp; If squares are free and orthogonally adjacent to each other, and form stairs of which the lower piece can be climbed by our pawn, we can directly climb to their top.\\n&nbsp; &nbsp; If a square is located in front of ours orthogonally, our pawn can jump on it provided that it's one floor higher, and that every floor between is lower.\\n&nbsp; &nbsp; If the four squares around our pawn are blocked by whether pawns, temples, pieces that are at least two floors higher, or the edge of the board, you can place a new piece under it.\\n&nbsp;\\nThere are squares with special properties for each location. It's up to you to discover which effects the gods have awarded them.\\n&nbsp;\\nGame modes:\\n&nbsp;\\nThere are two game modes: Arena and Puzzles.\\n&nbsp;\\n&nbsp; &nbsp; Arena is a set of 24 multiplayer levels, taking place in the locations of all the different civilizations and using their particular special squares. Two to six players (humans or A.I.) compete to build temples.\\n&nbsp; &nbsp; Puzzles mode is a scripted solo adventure where you have to solve several levels to advance to the next ones. The player has a limited amount of moves to build a single temple, whether alone or against opponents in later stages.\",\n",

Pursued by aliens, it’s up to the lowly security droids to save humanity. Taking up arms solo or with a friend, you must dance with death in a brutal and addictive arcade platformer shooter inspired by Super Crate Box and stuffed to the brim with unlockables.\\nFight through rapid fire single screen levels each with a random combination of platform layout, objective, vending machines and enemies. Dodge and weave amongst the aliens to stay alive but don’t leave them standing too long or the ship’s radiation will mutate them into bigger, nastier versions.&nbsp;\\n\\nOnly by unlocking and mastering the wild variety of weapons, explosives, special abilities, defense moves and perks can you hope to survive across all three galaxies, rid your ship of the mutant menace and save the oblivious humans.\\n\\nFeatures\\n\\nIntense &amp; Brutal Action\\nRapid fire levels give you no rest as hordes of enemies arrive, hell-bent on your destruction. Clear the objective quickly and be sure to kill each enemy before it has the chance to mutate into a bigger, nastier version of itself. Take a tiny breather and then it’s on to the next room.\\nDance with Death\\n\\nIn the tight confines of the space freighter, standing still is not an option. Your ability to dodge around enemies is as important as your aim. Survival requires quick thinking and rapid reflexes and a true master of the dance is a beautiful thing to behold.\\nDifferent Every Time\\n\\nEach single screen level is randomised, drawing on a pool of platform layouts, objective types and enemies as well as which vending machines will be present. You’ll never know which weapons or grenades will spawn in the vending machines whilst crate drops containing special abilities, sidearms, perks and defense moves are also random, adding further to the mind-boggling possible combinations.\\nOverflowing with Unlockables\\n\\nA wealth of weapons, sidearms, special abilities, perks, explosives, defense moves and character skins awaits you. Each new unlockable joins the melting pot of random ingredients, increasing your options but also the need to master each individual element and the way they combine with each other.\\nPlay Solo or with a Friend\\n\\nTake on the mutant hordes by yourself or team up in local co-op. Two player adds further complications to master as you must be careful to avoid friendly fire from explosives and will have to share/fight over item and health pack drops.',\n",

Each story you find lets you experience the life of a new family member on the day of their death, with stories ranging from the distant past to the present day.\\n\\nThe gameplay and tone of the stories are as varied as the Finches themselves. The only constants are that each is played from a first-person perspective and that each story ends with that family member's death.\\n\\nUltimately, it's a game about what it feels like to be humbled and astonished by the vast and unknowable world around us.\\n\\nCreated by Giant Sparrow, the team behind the first-person painting game The Unfinished Swan.\",\n",

       "     'description': 'The Story&nbsp;\\nMany people equate China with the lunar calendar, but the sun has also played a pivotal role in how the Chinese view life cycles. The ancient Chinese developed what is known as the 24 solar terms, which prescribed how people lived and worked, especially in rural areas. The solar terms originated between the 16th and 11th centuries BC and were perfected in their present form during the Western Han Dynasty (206-220 BC). Pure Mahjong explores each of these 24 solar terms over the course of the year – both the main screen and the game itself adjust to the season, displaying typical motifs and objects along with some interesting trivia.&nbsp; &nbsp;\\n\\nDesign: a completely new approach with amazing results&nbsp;\\n\\nEvery picture you see in Pure Mahjong is a lovingly created collage based on real photographs. Nothing like this has ever been used in a computer game, and the experience for the player is something completely different from the pixelated effects that pop up in even the latest titles.&nbsp;\\n\\nEach of the 24 seasons (called solar terms) has been created as a work of art, combining amazing and traditional sights from all over China according to the season. \\nWhile the main screen introduces the current season, the Mahjong games themselves are displayed on 24 beautifully decorated changing backgrounds.&nbsp;\\nLevels: Intelligent entertainment that can last minutes or hours \\nWith more than 1,000 individually designed levels, Pure Mahjong provides enough variety for months of challenging gameplay. While some levels can be solved in minutes, other may take hours to finally crack. There is a solution for every single level.&nbsp;\\nAs a special feature, you can compare your personal results with those of other players that have solved each individual level before you.&nbsp;\\nOn every single day of the year, four new levels await you to be solved. From (relatively) easy to very difficult, players can expect real challenges. For each solved level, the player is awarded with a calorie-free fortune cookie. More than 700 different messages await discovery!&nbsp;\\n\\nMusic: A relaxing, uplifting soundtrack&nbsp;\\n\\nWe’ve listened to hundreds of relaxing Chinese-themed songs for close to a year to create a soundtrack of more than 20 inspiring, unobtrusive tracks. The result is beautiful music that not only helps you concentrate and relax, but also completes the meditative experience of playing Pure Mahjong and stimulates your senses.&nbsp;\\nNatively created for Nintendo Switch™\\nPure Mahjong and its amazing visuals is without doubt a game for the big screen. Plus, its integrated screensaver will make you never want to switch it off. Our team has spent a lot of time making the gameplay and selection of tiles as easy and native as possible using even one Joy-Con™. However, the handheld mode is no less fun, and the game is a delight to play with the touch screen.&nbsp;\\nBonus: The most beautiful screensaver&nbsp;\\nOver several months, we’ve collected and licensed hundreds of amazing super high-resolution photographs, covering nature, customs, architecture, food and many other topics that reflect today’s China. The collection really is amazing, and it can be enjoyed by those who connect their Nintendo Switch™ console to their big-screen TV. Our entire team now uses this screensaver with the relaxing soundtrack on their TVs at home.',\n",

With an emphasis on culture and character, ANOTHER SIGHT focuses on the emotional development of the relationship between its two protagonists, Kit, a refreshingly intrepid teenager, and Hodge – a mysterious red-furred cat. They meet in the darkness of a London Underground construction site, after Kit loses her sight when the tunnel she had been exploring collapses. They team up for an adventure into the unexpected, with Hodge proving himself to be an indispensable companion, upon whom Kit will come to rely.&nbsp;\\nKit and Hodge explore a surreal fantasy world, both together and separately, each using their own unique talents to make their way through compelling environments, and to solve intriguing puzzles.',\n",

Keep within spitting distance of the wall to receive a short, colourful Second Wind speed boost and gain the opportunity to be one eighth euphoric.\\nNot enough for you?

My new adventure, Leisure Suit Larry - Wet Dreams Don’t Dry, takes me – whatever the route or twist of fate – from the end of the ’80s directly into the 21st century and wow, how the world has changed! While my view of the world and women from way back in the 1980s collides with modern reality harder than the breasts of a lusciously stacked blonde jogging along a beach, I’m all set to date my way across the modern world!&nbsp;\\nIn a “point &amp; click” adventure I’d call typical for the genre we mutually experience how I fall head-over-heels in love with Faith, the hot-to-trot assistant to the boss at Prune, a technology enterprise successful worldwide. Since even dating is done digitally nowadays, the first thing I have to do is to work on my score at Timber, the totally hip, can’t-get-anywhere-without-it dating app where I date women, satisfy their needs, and accordingly pick up points for my Timber profile. And whenever I get a chance in between, always briefly check out a few new bikini pix at Instacrap – the 21st century is gnarly smill!\\n\\nFeatures:\\n\\n• Leisure Suit Larry is coming in the 21st century – and no, there’s no word missing here\\n\\n• Explore a lovingly designed, non-linear game world set in the modern world with over 30 handdrawn venues\\n\\n• Use “Timber”, the ingame app, along with an innovative dating mechanism to date women, consequently improve your score at Timber, and ultimately clear the way to get to Faith, the women of your dreams\\n\\n• Solve true-blue puzzles and interact with over 30 handdrawn characters',\n",

Who created these objects? When? And for what reason? No one knew nor had the means to know, but continued to extract and use their colossal power.\\nHowever, the Remnants' immense power gradually caused the world to fall out of balance. As further separation tore apart those who rule and those who follow, a war broke out―the beginning of a long and endless strife.\\nA thousand years later, this story begins.\\n■ Distinct Battle System\\nA command-style battle with ever-changing scenarios\\nComing in contact with enemies on the field will trigger battles. Strategize and make full use of the commands that change constantly depending on the positions and state of friendly and enemy forces.\\nMorale of friendly forces greatly affects the outcome of battle\\nIn battle, morale expresses the spirit of individuals and groups of both friendly and enemy forces. Higher morale has advantageous effects such as increasing the attack stat to deal more damage, or decreasing damage dealt by the enemy.\",\n",

The lower your health the higher the bonus the greater the risk. Every time you extract your score is marked. Why you ask?

By slashing hordes of shadow monsters in the past, Warlocks have angered the Gods, who now turned against them. In result, you can now either give up, ask for mercy and then quietly die, as “mercy” is not a word easily found in Dark Gods’ vocabulary.&nbsp; Or you could release all your godlike powers instead and make the Gods pay for their betrayal.\\nBe sure though, that they’re not willing to go without a fight and they’ll throw at you all kinds of seemingly hilarious pixel art opponents. Don't be fooled by their funny looks however as rest assured, they’ll use any means necessary including their special skill sets to take you down. With the aid of giant bosses they will bring your skills to the test. Slay or get slain. There’s no other way.\\n\\nIn Warlocks 2: God Slayers you’ll find:\\n\\n● Hilarious pixel art with hand-drawn animations;\\n● Dynamic hack'n’slash experience in solo and local co-op;\\n● More than 40 types of challenging enemies that work together to take you down, using their unique skill sets;\\n● Extensive maps with tons of randomly generated loot to be picked up;\\n● 5 different types of Warlocks to pick up from, each with their own abilities to unlock throughout the game;\\n● 8-10 hours of gameplay to complete the adventure with one Warlock\\n● Varied powerful and enormous bosses only waiting to get slain.\",\n",

       "     'description': '&nbsp;Just like the title says, Bigger and Boulder cranks up the surrealism and gameplay to be, well... BIGGER AND BOULDER. With an emphasis on the chaotic new 2-vs-2 multiplayer, new time periods, and improved graphics, physics, and destructibility powered by Unreal Engine 4, players will need to be ready for some intense rocking and rolling.&nbsp;\\nRock of Ages II: Bigger and Boulder features:&nbsp;\\n\\n- ACE Team’s Trademark Quirkiness - The Monty Python-esque humor is turned up to 11, as players literally rock and roll through the ages. Humorous animated vignettes will also make a return in full force, so famous historical figures beware!&nbsp;\\n\\n- An Emphasis on Multiplayer - A little friendly competition never hurt anyone, so that’s why ACE Team decided to improve the multiplayer feature of the game. Play with up to four players online in a 2v2 match to the death with the ability to customize banners and colors for your “units.” Oh, and did we mention that opposing tracks can now intersect each other?&nbsp;\\n- A Positively Absurd Art Style - Just like in the original game, ACE Team has created various levels inspired by the greatest art periods in history.&nbsp; Players will gaze upon exquisite art from the Egyptians, Late Gothic and Early Renaissance era, Surrealist movement, as they carve a path of destruction with their rolling rocks of doom!&nbsp;&nbsp;\\n- Improved Physics and Destructible Environments - With upgraded physics and even more things to be cracked, crushed, flattened, and slammed, rolling various rocks down a hill has never been a more pleasant experience!\\n- Utter Chaos - With the addition of brand new defensive units and unique boulders with special traits, chaos reigns supreme so be sure not to take each turn for granite.&nbsp;',\n",

To ensure their songs live on, the warring guildsmen of the city will go to sinister lengths to acquire Mascherines - masks that grant their wielders the power to channel the elements and cast destructive magic.&nbsp;\\n\\nExplore the city’s chaos as the investigator Cicero Gavar, who was exiled for a crime against the state five years ago. Now summoned back to Ombre to solve the mysterious kidnapping of a diplomat, Cicero finds himself surrounded by doubtful and deceitful characters as he works to unearth a deeper conspiracy within the shadows of this Mascherine-mad city.\\n\\nFEATURES:\\n\\n• Your Fight, Your Pace: Use the tactical pause to control the rush of combat, position your party and plan their attacks by the second.\\n• A Game of Tag: Lay elemental magic tags upon your enemies, and activate the tags with another element for crowd-controlling status effects!\\n• Vivid Comicbook Art: Feast your eyes on dreamy colours and environmental linework inspired by French comic artists, blended with stylized 3D characters for a timeless aesthetic.',\n",

You utilise weapons and soldiers distinct to that period in European warfare, making key decisions to turn the tide of war.\\nIn battle you manage not only military units of the era, using their capabilities for the greatest strategic advantage, but you also manage your cities, Generals and even members of royalty. Creating units, boosting wartime economies and enhancing unit capabilities all play a key role in success or failure.\\n\\nThere are three key modes to test your skills! The lengthy Campaign takes you from the battlefields of Europe to the US War of Independence and beyond. In Conquest you choose from a wide range of nations and seek domination over the continent through nation building. Finally there are challenges, special levels that test your strategic nous and understanding of the game mechanics.\\n\\nThis is accompanied by incredible attention to detail, including historically accurate descriptions of the nations, leaders and battles of the era. Are you ready for battle?',\n",

The dark power that fueled that war has vanished, but darkness is descending once more and Adam's legendary hero, Orazio, is no more.&nbsp;\\n10 years ago he left without explanation and never returned, leaving his son and adopted daughter to wrestle with the dark secret he left behind—a secret that must now be revealed if the children hope to save both Adam and their departed father, though its revelation could unhinge the world.&nbsp;\\n\\nShadows of Adam is a creative, humorous and exciting take on the 16-bit JRPG era, but with its own twists and style for the modern day gamer. Fast-paced battles, gorgeous graphics, an awesome soundtrack and the convenience to save anywhere you like make it tough to resist! Whether playing on the TV or in handheld mode, the game’s glorious pixels will immerse you in the adventure and its memorable scenes.\\n\\nFeatures:\\n\\n• Compelling Character Driven Story: Shadows of Adam’s story is one with a deep narrative and an interesting plot. The story revolves around 4 main characters: Asrael, Kellan, Curtis and Talon.\\n\\n• A Strategic AP Management Battle System: AP is restored between each round of battle automatically and through defeating enemies. This allows a unique attrition system that encourages skill use and fast combat.\\n• Beautiful Visuals: Shadows of Adam features beautifully modernized visuals inspired by classic JRPGs of the '90s.\\n• Original Soundtrack With Over 44 Tracks: An original soundtrack by Tyler Mire that’s inspired by music from the genre's greatest games. This soundtrack includes unique themes for each area and character and has an emphasis on strong melodies and an emotional connection.\",\n",

       "     'description': \"The Swords of Ditto: Mormo's Curse is a compact action RPG that creates a unique adventure for each new hero of legend in the relentless fight against the evil Mormo. Explore a delightful but dangerous overworld, brave menacing dungeons, and improve your hero in a charming village, during your quest to overcome the evil that plagues the island. Unleash the mystical Sword of Ditto and grab a co-op friend for an unforgettable adventure filled with delightful characters, extraordinary loot, and heroic battles!\\nKey Features:\\n\\nUnique Adventures Linked Together: Each adventure becomes its own legend, both distinct from those that came before it and part of a heroic legacy that bind together. The deeds, successes, and failures of each hero's adventure have implications for those that follow including the ability to find weapons and recover loot from history’s fallen heroes.\\n\\nSolo &amp; Cooperative Adventuring: Battle Mormo and her evil armies alone or summon a brave friend to take up arms alongside you in local co-op mode. Fear not, even less experienced adventurers will find help from their fellow heroes through the magic of a good old-fashioned revival hug!\\n\\nWeapons, Items, &amp; Stickers: Wield the traditional sword and bow combo alongside the decidedly less traditional vinyl record Frisbee, magic golf club, and colossal foot from the heavens to put Mormo and her legions back on their heels. Collect and equip stickers to boost up your hero and add perks to their gear to become powerful enough to banish the wicked sorceress.&nbsp;\\n\\nMain Quests and Secret Side Missions: Approach your legend however you see fit by battling through dungeons in any order, completing side missions through dark caverns and deep wells, or confront Mormo right from the start for the ultimate challenge.\",\n",

Dig for bones across four worlds of increasing difficulty. Battle enemies above perilous cliffs and sunken desert caves. Die a lot.\\n\\nFree Dig – An endless digging experience. Dig through an infinite set of levels with minor challenge and no game overs. Progress is saved.\\n\\n• Forge your own path as you creatively tunnel through each level.\\n\\n• Travel to new worlds! Uncover stranger and more dangerous environments.\\n• Hunt for bones and treasure as you dive deeper.\\n• Discover shops and buy items, but don't get too greedy!\\n• Keep sniffing out bones to unlock a variety of color themes.\\n• A thumpin’ 8-bit soundtrack you’ll surely dig.\\nA WORD FROM THE DEVELOPER\\n\\nEach time you play Dig Dog, the levels are freshly generated. Of course the worlds get steadily harder, but as you dig more you’ll discover a variety of challenges and goals. Will you spend your coins on a helpful item at the shop in 1-3 or horde them in an attempt for a high score. Maybe you’ll try to unlock new Warp Bones or try and beat all 4 worlds without dying.\\n\\nOr maybe just chill out in Free Dig mode with some cathartic digging. I love destructive environments. You can pretty much dig up a whole level if you want. (Although that can be quite dangerous.)\\n\\nAs you dig more, you may start to find some of the game’s hidden depths. For instance, if you fast stomp on an enemy you’ll create sparks that ripple to the left and right. These sparks are both useful and dangerous. It depends on when and how you use them.\\n\\nOn a personal note, Dig Dog was the first game I've programmed and drawn without using my hands. It was a challenge to make the game this way and I'm quite relieved that it's now complete.\\n\\nI hope you enjoy Dig Dog. I think there’s a lot to uncover here!\\n\\n-Rusty\\ufeff\",\n",

Set off on a crazy journey to solve the surreal puzzles of Homo Machina and learn about the internal working of the human body, represented as a gigantic 1920s factory.\\nIn this narrative puzzle, players are plunged into an ingenious system of nerves, vessels and valves. The aim is to help the body function correctly in about thirty steps or so throughout the entire day. Each scene breaks down daily acts, such as opening your eyes, chewing a toast or listening to music, through seamless navigation and intuitive and inventive gameplay.\\nFritz Kahn, a pioneer of infographics and popular science, came up with easy to understand analogies to enable people to improve their understanding of the human body. By combining old school design with a contemporary influence, Homo Machina delights with its clever dialogue between the absent-minded director at the helm of the body-machine and Josiane, his diligent secretary, encouraging players to put to task the armada of workers to get the incredible factory up and running.\\nAfter Californium, Homo Machina is the new video game created by Darjeeling production. It was edited and co-produced by ARTE, European culture digital and TV channel, and Feierabend.',\n",

If you write the kanji in his stomach correctly many times, you will defeat the ghost. The second challenge is called the “Hide and Seek Challenge”. In this challenge, parts of a kanji are hidden behind many mirrors, can you guess what the kanji is by looking at just parts of it? If so, then write them as fast and as accurately as possible and get rid of the ghosts. The more ghosts you defeat, the closer you will get to solving the secret of my mystery puzzle. Writing kanji correctly many times is the best way to learn Japanese kanji.

The goal of Circuits: to piece together the different parts of a song. Sounds easy, but maybe it's not...\\n&nbsp;\\nAs we love music, we wanted to make a game that gives the player an insight into how music is created and makes listening the core part of the experience. Packed with beautifullly designed minimal graphics, to not disturb the focus of the game, and 25 different songs for the player to reconstruct. So if you like music, you will like Circuits .\\n&nbsp;\\nFeatures:\\n* Engaging gameplay that gives an insight into music creation for players\\n* A soundtrack mix of electronic ambient,dubstep, and epic orchestra composed by David García (Deadlight, Rime...)\\n* Beautiful minimal design\\n* And a Turbo Mode!\",\n",

       "     'description': \"A single bit of computer memory became sentient and decided to escape \\n      from digital into the real world. Explore RAM, modify bytes and hack \\n      machine code and CPU registers to set it free.\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      The game is about the way computers work internally. Having some \\n      programming knowledge makes the game easier, but it isn't required. All \\n      the elements required to solve the puzzles are explained in the game.\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      How does it play?\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      You play the game as a single bit of computer memory. You can invade \\n      other bytes around you and thus modify their values. The game features \\n      various types of puzzles:\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      1. Explore\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      With ability to XOR into adjacent bytes, you can navigate your way \\n      through existing data in the memory. The game automatically marks the \\n      bytes you cannot go through without getting yourself overwritten and \\n      prevents you entering those. Both binary and ASCII views are available, \\n      which you can utilize to find an open path for a particular puzzle.\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      2. Decipher programs\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      Various programs run on the computer you are trying to escape from. The \\n      game includes a disassembler showing you the assembly language \\n      corresponding to the machine code that is being executed. Don't worry if \\n      you don't know any Assembly. There are only a handful of CPU \\n      instructions and they are introduced gradually as you complete the \\n      puzzles. Reading the assembly code, you can track the program logic, see \\n      which parts of RAM it reads and writes to and manipulate data in those \\n      locations to get the program to do what you want.\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      3. Invade CPU registers\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      The computer you are trying to escape has a simple CPU with a couple of \\n      registers. You can trick the CPU to load yourself into the registers and \\n      affect code execution or offload yourself into otherwise unreachable \\n      memory locations.\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      4. Hack\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      For some puzzles, it isn't enough to change the data in RAM or \\n      registers. You can also change the machine code to get the computer to \\n      do different things.\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      Gameplay Tips:\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      Carefully observe the bytes on the screen and what the CPU is doing. \\n      Sometimes you need to read the code in straightforward manner. Sometimes \\n      you need to work your way backwards: find the line of the code you want \\n      executed and then trace the code backwards to figure out how to trick \\n      the CPU to get to that instruction.\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      The game only has about 30 puzzles, but some of those might take \\n      considerable effort to solve. So take it easy and don't rush to the end. \\n      If you solve a puzzle by accident, don't go forward until you understand \\n      why it happened. You might miss some small detail and get completely \\n      stuck on the next puzzle.\",\n",

Eve has been infected by mutant cells that are slowly corrupting her body, so together with Jason and Fred, they board G-SOPHIA and begin an intergalactic journey to Eve's home planet, Sophia, in hopes of finding a cure for the mutant infection.\\n&nbsp;\\nA perfect blend of action-adventure through outer space and the signature Blaster Master gameplay creates a formula for a fun new experience.\\n&nbsp;\\n●G-SOPHIA's Gaea System is the key to maximum mutant blasting efficiency!\\nThe Gaea System converts the energy created by the impact of falling from tall heights or taking damage, then turns that energy into SP. By making good use of the terrain, more and more SP can be recovered, allowing Jason to use more of G-SOPHIA's sub-weapons.\\nMastering the Gaia System brings out G-SOPHIA's full potential, allowing players to traverse stages in an ultra-satisfying way.\\n&nbsp;\\n●Get familiar with Jason's new technique, the BLAST COUNTER.\\nJason's got a new trick up his sleeve! In top-down view stages, Jason can initiate a BLAST COUNTER at the moment an enemy makes an attack, allowing him to deliver a powerful counterattack.\\nGetting a feel for BLAST COUNTERS allows you to dish out lots of damage and make good use of your wide variety of gun levels and sub-weapons. This is the key to clearing top-down view stages with speed!\\n&nbsp;\\n●Power up G-SOPHIA and Jason as you travel across the galaxy!\\nSearch high and low across the planets you visit to find hidden maps for small planetoids in their orbit. Explore a wide variety of planetoids and find upgrades for G-SOPHIA and Jason.\\n&nbsp;\\n●A whole new group of Metal Attackers with their own pilots and support droids takes the stage!\\nThroughout his journey, Jason crosses paths with a motley cast of Metal Attacker battle-tank pilots and their respective support droids. Sometimes they're friend, sometimes they're foe.\\n&nbsp;\\n※The Blaster Master Zero series was born after Inti Creates acquired the license for the original Blaster Master game for the Nintendo Entertainment System from Sunsoft.\",\n",

As well as every part of the \\n      sky being procedurally generated, there are also three optional Augments \\n      that are randomly assigned before a game that adjust a range of stats \\n      and enable very special features, drastically affecting gameplay \\n      experience.\\n    \\n    \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n      Powerups, Augments, and bashing enemies, combined with using natural sky \\n      phenomena in a skillful way, will help you achieve the highest possible \\n      score - the primary goal of BombFall. Can you make the lightning quick \\n      decisions necessary to stay alive, boost score, and explode in the right \\n      place?\",\n",
