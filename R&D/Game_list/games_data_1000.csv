Erina may be a little rabbit that was turned into a human, but that doesn’t stop her from being capable of some pretty neat moves.
Both Erina and Ribbon’s abilities can be improved by learning new skills and attacks through collecting items and upgrades that are spread throughout the world.

If your answer is 10 or more, then you are ready for &quot;Contraptions&quot; - a game where the goal is to fix whacky contraptions that perform simple tasks in indirect and convoluted ways, Rube Goldberg style.
Use camels as trampolines, champagne bottles as cannons, balloons to lift objects, fireworks wheels to drive conveyor belts, magnets to attract metal objects, and many more gadgets to solve the puzzles and clear the levels.
&nbsp;
Features
+ Solve over 100 wacky puzzles across 5 different worlds.
+ Create an unlimited number of your own levels and challenge a friend to try to beat it.
+ Use a plethora of goofy gadgets from scissors to washing-line pegs.
+ Complete the levels in multiple ways...get as bonkers and creative as you like.
&nbsp;
Gameplay
On every level there are a number of objects and monsters...The goal is to rid the level of the monsters.
This can be achieved in different ways...The objects are affected by the laws of physics and play a key part in solving the puzzle. The objects form a “contraption” which are placed in such a way, which creates a chain reaction that will wipe out all monsters. The catch is that the contraption is broken - some objects are not in the right place. Your goal is to fix the contraption. You do this, by repositioning, flipping, or connecting the different objects.
When the level starts “time is frozen”, gravity doesn’t affect the objects and all machines or gadgets are not running. During this time you can move things around, connect things, flip things, in order to make the chain reaction work. Once you are done, you set things in motion (unfreeze time) by pressing the Play button and watch things play out.
If you did everything correctly the chain reaction will wipe out all monsters and you will progress to the next level. If your solution is not correct, you can pause the contraption and fiddle with the objects again.
&nbsp;
Gadgets
Some of the gadgets are activated by igniting them, other by touching, pushing or pulling them. Some gadgets work on their own, while other gadgets must be connected together to function. For example in order for the conveyor belt to turn, it must be connected to an active engine, using a belt. Likewise in order for the laser gun to fire a laser, the trigger must be connected with a rope, to a moving object, like a car.
&nbsp;
Objectives
There dozens of ways you can rid the levels of the monsters. It all depends on what objects are you presented with. The simplest way is if the monster is pushed off the edge of a platform and falls off the screen. Other ways include cutting a rope holding a heavy object, which will smash the monster; pulling a rope, connected to a laser gun; igniting the engine of a rocket with a lighter in which the monster is in, etc.
&nbsp;
The solution is achieved through chain reactions, Rube Goldberg style. For example: in order to shoot the monster with a laser, you might have to connect a rope to the trigger, the other end to a rocket. You will need to ignite the engine of the rocket, which will pull the rope, which will trigger the laser gun, which will ultimately eliminate the monster. The more you progress through the game, the more complex the new puzzles become.&nbsp;",Contraptions,/games/detail/contraptions-switch,'Online Play via Nintendo Switch Online',1 player,767ebe6c-36eb-3711-b089-5f7ca1f9a531,na,False,contraptions-switch

Psychology plays a huge role within the game: heroes and enemies are atypical and the line between good and evil is blurred. The plot is rich of unpredictable twists, but touching at the same time. The development of the game is similar to that of a film narration, where the player perfectly identifies himself with the character. The soundtrack, composed by Nobuko Toda and Luca Balboni, enhances the terrifying atmosphere of the game.

The story revolves around Rosemary Reed, a fascinating 35-year-old woman, who reaches Richard Felton’s house, in order to investigate on the disappearance of a girl called Celeste. The woman is greeted by Gloria, the nurse who takes care of old Richard. When Dr. Felton understands Rosemary’s true intentions, the dread begins.

Don’t get too close to your enemy, act like an unperceivable shadow, hiding yourself from his sight. Or just mix these dynamics together.

- Psychological plot - Characters in the story are everyday people that turn themselves into scary monsters.

- Movie-like cutscenes - Thanks to his impressive direction, Chris Darril puts into play a story rich of complex life-like characters.
&nbsp;
Audio clues - Use the soundtrack and the 3D audio sound effects to understand when your stalkers are getting closer.

Before league matches conduct sparing with other teams, to prepare the appropriate tactics. In sparing you can test different combinations of Special Skills, select weapons, behavior and observe their impact on the game.

Start in Sponsored Tournaments to gain experience and earn cash prizes.

To reach the very top there is hard work and loads of matches to play.

In Eight-Minute Empire, 2-5 players take turns selecting a card from the six displayed. This card gives the player a resource, and also has an action which the player takes immediately. Actions help players take over the map, but the resources are worth points at the end of the game, so players have to balance the two aspects. Players spread across the map in order to collect points at the end of the game by having majority control in regions and continents.

Divine Ascent is a single and local-multiplayer strategy-puzzle game. The goal is to be the first to build towers, and to reach their tops to place temples.

Six of the biggest civilizations of the ancient times compete against each other, to be the one taken by the gods to the heavens. To this end, they've elected builders whose sole purpose is to erect monuments as high in the sky as possible.

Key Features:

&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; Arena (local-multiplayer) and Puzzles (single player) modes
&nbsp; &nbsp; Arena is a set of 24 multiplayer levels for two to six players (humans or A.I.)
&nbsp; &nbsp; Single player mode contains 30 puzzles with increasing difficulty, plus the final stage which is sort of an Arena level against 5 opponents
&nbsp; &nbsp; Special moves
&nbsp; &nbsp; Tile-based isometric 3D graphics
&nbsp; &nbsp; Each civilization has its own theme and atmospheric background sound design
&nbsp;
Game mechanics:
&nbsp;
The game is turn-based, in a board game style. The goal is to be the first to place three temples. A temple appears when you place a pawn on a tower five pieces high, or three pieces high in puzzle mode.
&nbsp;
The player begins by placing his pawn on any square located on the base floor. If there is no such available square, he must place it on the lowest free floor. You must place it again in the same way after making a temple appear.
&nbsp;
Each turn, the player has two move options:
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; The pawn can be moved orthogonally to another adjacent free square of the board, whether on the same floor, one floor higher, or one floor lower.
&nbsp; &nbsp; You can use the piece in the corner of the screen to add it on a free square of the board.
&nbsp;
Special moves:
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; If squares are free and orthogonally adjacent to each other, and form stairs of which the lower piece can be climbed by our pawn, we can directly climb to their top.
&nbsp; &nbsp; If a square is located in front of ours orthogonally, our pawn can jump on it provided that it's one floor higher, and that every floor between is lower.
&nbsp; &nbsp; If the four squares around our pawn are blocked by whether pawns, temples, pieces that are at least two floors higher, or the edge of the board, you can place a new piece under it.
&nbsp;
There are squares with special properties for each location. It's up to you to discover which effects the gods have awarded them.
&nbsp;
Game modes:
&nbsp;
There are two game modes: Arena and Puzzles.
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; Arena is a set of 24 multiplayer levels, taking place in the locations of all the different civilizations and using their particular special squares. Two to six players (humans or A.I.) compete to build temples.
&nbsp; &nbsp; Puzzles mode is a scripted solo adventure where you have to solve several levels to advance to the next ones.

As Edith, you’ll explore the colossal Finch house, searching for stories as she explores her family history and tries to figure out why she's the last one in her family left alive. Each story you find lets you experience the life of a new family member on the day of their death, with stories ranging from the distant past to the present day.

The gameplay and tone of the stories are as varied as the Finches themselves. The only constants are that each is played from a first-person perspective and that each story ends with that family member's death.

Ultimately, it's a game about what it feels like to be humbled and astonished by the vast and unknowable world around us.

566,'Available now',"'Board Game', 'Education', 'Strategy', 'Puzzle'",False,,,,"The Story&nbsp;
Many people equate China with the lunar calendar, but the sun has also played a pivotal role in how the Chinese view life cycles. The ancient Chinese developed what is known as the 24 solar terms, which prescribed how people lived and worked, especially in rural areas. The solar terms originated between the 16th and 11th centuries BC and were perfected in their present form during the Western Han Dynasty (206-220 BC). Pure Mahjong explores each of these 24 solar terms over the course of the year – both the main screen and the game itself adjust to the season, displaying typical motifs and objects along with some interesting trivia.&nbsp; &nbsp;

Design: a completely new approach with amazing results&nbsp;

Every picture you see in Pure Mahjong is a lovingly created collage based on real photographs. Nothing like this has ever been used in a computer game, and the experience for the player is something completely different from the pixelated effects that pop up in even the latest titles.&nbsp;

Each of the 24 seasons (called solar terms) has been created as a work of art, combining amazing and traditional sights from all over China according to the season. 
While the main screen introduces the current season, the Mahjong games themselves are displayed on 24 beautifully decorated changing backgrounds.&nbsp;
Levels: Intelligent entertainment that can last minutes or hours 
With more than 1,000 individually designed levels, Pure Mahjong provides enough variety for months of challenging gameplay. While some levels can be solved in minutes, other may take hours to finally crack. There is a solution for every single level.&nbsp;
As a special feature, you can compare your personal results with those of other players that have solved each individual level before you.&nbsp;
On every single day of the year, four new levels await you to be solved. From (relatively) easy to very difficult, players can expect real challenges. For each solved level, the player is awarded with a calorie-free fortune cookie. More than 700 different messages await discovery!&nbsp;

Music: A relaxing, uplifting soundtrack&nbsp;

We’ve listened to hundreds of relaxing Chinese-themed songs for close to a year to create a soundtrack of more than 20 inspiring, unobtrusive tracks. The result is beautiful music that not only helps you concentrate and relax, but also completes the meditative experience of playing Pure Mahjong and stimulates your senses.&nbsp;
Natively created for Nintendo Switch™
Pure Mahjong and its amazing visuals is without doubt a game for the big screen. Plus, its integrated screensaver will make you never want to switch it off. Our team has spent a lot of time making the gameplay and selection of tiles as easy and native as possible using even one Joy-Con™. However, the handheld mode is no less fun, and the game is a delight to play with the touch screen.&nbsp;
Bonus: The most beautiful screensaver&nbsp;
Over several months, we’ve collected and licensed hundreds of amazing super high-resolution photographs, covering nature, customs, architecture, food and many other topics that reflect today’s China. The collection really is amazing, and it can be enjoyed by those who connect their Nintendo Switch™ console to their big-screen TV. Our entire team now uses this screensaver with the relaxing soundtrack on their TVs at home.",Pure Mahjong,/games/detail/pure-mahjong-switch,,1 player,9a60432f-16e9-37d3-8ec2-967b07c815fc,na,False,pure-mahjong-switch

Step into the shoes of Sir Albert Wickes and The Right Honourable Clarence Baxter, two 19th century explorers who have chosen to pilot the HMS Fearful on its maiden voyage to Mars.

When the steam engine runs out of coal, the ship's cat shreds the navigation chart, and the tea gets cold, it becomes clear that interstellar transportation isn't a walk in the park. It will take the talents of two players working together on the problems that arise to get to Mars in one piece.

A WORD FROM THE DEVELOPER

Each time you play Dig Dog, the levels are freshly generated. Of course the worlds get steadily harder, but as you dig more you’ll discover a variety of challenges and goals. Will you spend your coins on a helpful item at the shop in 1-3 or horde them in an attempt for a high score. Maybe you’ll try to unlock new Warp Bones or try and beat all 4 worlds without dying.

Or maybe just chill out in Free Dig mode with some cathartic digging. I love destructive environments. You can pretty much dig up a whole level if you want. (Although that can be quite dangerous.)

As you dig more, you may start to find some of the game’s hidden depths. For instance, if you fast stomp on an enemy you’ll create sparks that ripple to the left and right. These sparks are both useful and dangerous. It depends on when and how you use them.

On a personal note, Dig Dog was the first game I've programmed and drawn without using my hands. It was a challenge to make the game this way and I'm quite relieved that it's now complete.

I hope you enjoy Dig Dog. I think there’s a lot to uncover here!

Getting together with friends, fighting bosses—that’s all cool, but having some time for yourself is pretty awesome too.
There are times we like to spend some time alone having fun, and taking on challenges in a game is an awesome way to do just that.
ALPHA, the latest work by KANAME, is a simple game. There are no additional in-game purchases: once it's yours, you can begin tackling it until you reach the end. Maybe it’s time to take a break from playing games for other people.

◆ Key features of ALPHA

◎　A single-player action shooting game. Quite a challenging one, in fact.

◎　Average play time of 2 hours (or, if you like to spend more time, as long as you want)
◎　Knock off enemy bullets with your sword to shoot and slash your way through stages.
◎　No save points during stages. Enemies are tough, and so are the bosses. Study their moves and work around them.
◎　When it’s game over, you start over from the beginning of the stage. You won’t be getting it easy!
◎　Some health items, shields, bombs, etc. are just a few useful items.
◎　All this for a small price.",ALPHA,/games/detail/alpha-switch,,1 player,c914cd94-b52c-3309-9777-fd5297f103bd,na,False,alpha-switch

Musical tracks:

A fully original soundtrack, accompanying you on your perilous journey to the Grimoire. Each character and stage has a unique theme that captures and plays upon their essence.
Battle Relentless Bosses:

Your path is not an easy one. Face insane bosses, wielding great magical power and unleashing torrents of complex bullet patterns. They will stop at nothing to protect the Grimoire.&nbsp;
Unravel a world of mystery
As you explore and overcome every stage of the game learning more about the world first from the perspective of the Witch Thief, but later as many other unlockable characters you will experience new perspectives of the story.&nbsp;
Difficulty ranges:&nbsp;

Not everyone wants the hardest difficulty. Witch Thief ranges from practically no combat “Chill” mode to the extreme “Insanity” mode which increases both bullet counts and speed. Oh you only get one life there too.

A great study game for beginners.
In these days, Japanese food, among other aspects of the culture are very trendy around the world. With the upcoming Tokyo Olympics, the indulgence of Japanese culture will spike to new highs! So those visiting Japan are encouraged to begin their journey into the world of kanji or brush up on their skills in case they are feeling a little rusty.
For those of you who don’t know, kanji are characters used for writing that come from China. They are kind of like letters but look a lot more complicated than the basic 26 roman letters of English. And they are used in various writing systems. In fact, it is the second most used writing system in the entire world.
With this title, anyone can learn kanji starting from the elementary level and study various kanji used in everyday life. But you’ll have so much fun with this title, you’ll forget that you’re even studying. Moreover, having a grasp of kanji can really help make traveling in Japan a lot easier.
Using the Japanese learning style of immersion with repeated writing and memorization, you can practice writing kanji to your heart’s content using the Switch’s touch screen. Of course, aside from writing, you can also learn the kanji’s pronunciation and meaning as well.
So enjoy studying and learn how to use Japanese writing with style!
&lt;Learning contents&gt;
• Understand the meaning and pronunciation of kanji displayed on the screen, and gradually learn it as you practice writing it repeatedly and correctly until it becomes second nature.
• By understanding the kanji by looking at the different parts and meanings that make up a single kanji, you will be able to understand the kanji completely.
• In short, understanding the meaning of the kanjis and be able to write them with ease.
----------------For Kids----------------
The game’s setting and story:
“The name’s Greco! I live in the Hall of Kanji. Kanji are stylish and cool looking characters used in Japanese writing. There’s no doubt that you will become popular with the people of Japan if you learn them! In my hall of kanji you can do two types of study challenges against my ghosts. The first one is called the “Writing Challenge”. In this challenge a ghost will appear with a kanji inside of it. If you write the kanji in his stomach correctly many times, you will defeat the ghost. The second challenge is called the “Hide and Seek Challenge”. In this challenge, parts of a kanji are hidden behind many mirrors, can you guess what the kanji is by looking at just parts of it?

      -Scenario-
    
    
      Long ago, when gods lived amongst people...
    
    
      
    
    
      There lived a swordsman who was given five swords forged by god himself.
    
    
      
    
    
      Using these swords, the swordsman brought peace and order to the world.
    
    
      
    
    
      People called the swordsman, &quot;Wielder of the Five Swords&quot;...
    
    
      
    
    
      One day, during a fete to praise the gods, the blades of the swordsman 
      turn against the gods for reasons unknown.
    
    
      
    
    
      One of the gods, Ozone, furious with all his powers, sealed the 
      swordsman away at the top of a mountain now known as Swords Peak.
    
    
      
    
    
      This tale begins 5,000 years after the battle between the two, near a 
      the small village of Cardina.
    
    
      
    
    
      
    
    
      -Game Overview-
    
    
      
    
    
      -Seamless open-world game mechanics
    
    
      While the game features a rather old school &#8220;quarter view&#8221; mechanic, the 
      map transitions and event scenes, even the combat is all seamless as can 
      be to enhance the overall gaming experience.
    
    
      
    
    
      -Real time strategic action battle system
    
    
      Utilizing 2 primary attack buttons, users can assign different weapons 
      to each button to create a unique combo that fits the users need as they 
      go. Monsters, bosses and stage gimmicks can require a specific type of 
      weapon at times creating opportunities for users to strategize their 
      best route of approach.
    
    
      
    
    
      -Customizable Tattoo system
    
    
      Utilizing &quot;tattoos&quot;, users are given specific points upon leveling to 
      get the protagonist inked as a form of powering up so it could be built 
      to one&#8217;s own. Raising MAX HP and Stamina, learning new and special moves

      through 16 locations in the bazaar. In each such a location, you can 
      carry out a specific action. The challenge, however, is that to take an 
      action, you must move your merchant and an assistant there, then leave 
      the assistant behind to handle all the details while you focus on larger 
      matters. If you want to use that assistant again later, your merchant 
      must return to that location to pick him up. Thus, you must plan ahead

      from digital into the real world. Explore RAM, modify bytes and hack 
      machine code and CPU registers to set it free.
    
    
      
    
    
      The game is about the way computers work internally. Having some 
      programming knowledge makes the game easier, but it isn't required. All 
      the elements required to solve the puzzles are explained in the game.
    
    
      
    
    
      How does it play?
    
    
      
    
    
      You play the game as a single bit of computer memory. You can invade 
      other bytes around you and thus modify their values. The game features 
      various types of puzzles:
    
    
      
    
    
      1. Explore
    
    
      
    
    
      With ability to XOR into adjacent bytes, you can navigate your way 
      through existing data in the memory. The game automatically marks the 
      bytes you cannot go through without getting yourself overwritten and 
      prevents you entering those. Both binary and ASCII views are available, 
      which you can utilize to find an open path for a particular puzzle.
    
    
      
    
    
      2. Decipher programs
    
    
      
    
    
      Various programs run on the computer you are trying to escape from. The 
      game includes a disassembler showing you the assembly language 
      corresponding to the machine code that is being executed. Don't worry if 
      you don't know any Assembly. There are only a handful of CPU 
      instructions and they are introduced gradually as you complete the 
      puzzles. Reading the assembly code, you can track the program logic, see 
      which parts of RAM it reads and writes to and manipulate data in those 
      locations to get the program to do what you want.
    
    
      
    
    
      3. Invade CPU registers
    
    
      
    
    
      The computer you are trying to escape has a simple CPU with a couple of 
      registers. You can trick the CPU to load yourself into the registers and 
      affect code execution or offload yourself into otherwise unreachable 
      memory locations.
    
    
      
    
    
      4. Hack
    
    
      
    
    
      For some puzzles, it isn't enough to change the data in RAM or 
      registers. You can also change the machine code to get the computer to 
      do different things.
    
    
      
    
    
      Gameplay Tips:
    
    
      
    
    
      Carefully observe the bytes on the screen and what the CPU is doing. 
      Sometimes you need to read the code in straightforward manner. Sometimes 
      you need to work your way backwards: find the line of the code you want 
      executed and then trace the code backwards to figure out how to trick 
      the CPU to get to that instruction.
    
    
      
    
    
      The game only has about 30 puzzles, but some of those might take 
      considerable effort to solve. So take it easy and don't rush to the end. 
      If you solve a puzzle by accident, don't go forward until you understand 
      why it happened. You might miss some small detail and get completely 
      stuck on the next puzzle.",Rogue Bit,/games/detail/rogue-bit-switch,,1 player,d2bd6474-03c5-375b-812d-6309f61f66fc,na,False,rogue-bit-switch

Experience the yet-untold story of Jason and Eve after defeating Earth's mutant scourge as they venture into the depths of space in their new battle tank, &quot;GAIA-SOPHIA&quot;!
&nbsp;
The story of Blaster Master Zero 2 begins a few months after the events of the first game (released on March 9, 2017), where the main protagonist Jason saves planet Earth from the mutants. Eve has been infected by mutant cells that are slowly corrupting her body, so together with Jason and Fred, they board G-SOPHIA and begin an intergalactic journey to Eve's home planet, Sophia, in hopes of finding a cure for the mutant infection.
&nbsp;
A perfect blend of action-adventure through outer space and the signature Blaster Master gameplay creates a formula for a fun new experience.
&nbsp;
●G-SOPHIA's Gaea System is the key to maximum mutant blasting efficiency!
The Gaea System converts the energy created by the impact of falling from tall heights or taking damage, then turns that energy into SP. By making good use of the terrain, more and more SP can be recovered, allowing Jason to use more of G-SOPHIA's sub-weapons.
Mastering the Gaia System brings out G-SOPHIA's full potential, allowing players to traverse stages in an ultra-satisfying way.
&nbsp;
●Get familiar with Jason's new technique, the BLAST COUNTER.
Jason's got a new trick up his sleeve! In top-down view stages, Jason can initiate a BLAST COUNTER at the moment an enemy makes an attack, allowing him to deliver a powerful counterattack.
Getting a feel for BLAST COUNTERS allows you to dish out lots of damage and make good use of your wide variety of gun levels and sub-weapons. This is the key to clearing top-down view stages with speed!
&nbsp;
●Power up G-SOPHIA and Jason as you travel across the galaxy!
Search high and low across the planets you visit to find hidden maps for small planetoids in their orbit. Explore a wide variety of planetoids and find upgrades for G-SOPHIA and Jason.
&nbsp;
●A whole new group of Metal Attackers with their own pilots and support droids takes the stage!
Throughout his journey, Jason crosses paths with a motley cast of Metal Attacker battle-tank pilots and their respective support droids. Sometimes they're friend, sometimes they're foe.
