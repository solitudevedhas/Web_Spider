Use your puzzle skills to eliminate pesky viruses!

For the first time, take Turf War battles on-the-go with the Nintendo Switch™ system, and use any of the console's portable play styles for intense local multiplayer* action. Even team up for new 4-player co-op fun in Salmon Run!
Two years have passed since the original Splatoon™ game was released, and two years have also passed in Inkopolis! So expect a fresh wave of fashion, not to mention new weapons and gear. Dual wield the new Splat Dualies or stick to mainstays like chargers and rollers, which have been remixed with new strategic possibilities. As always, Turf War is the favored sport among Inklings, but they also dig ranked battles, taking down Octarians in a robust single-player campaign, and battling enemy Salmonids in one dangerous part-time job! No matter which way you play, splat at home or on-the-go with Nintendo Switch. Staying fresh never felt so good.

Turf War - Team up in fierce 4-on-4 multiplayer battles* to see which team can cover the most turf with ink
Salmon Run – 2-4 players* can team up for co-op fun and defeat waves of enemy Salmonids.
New weapons – Dual wield the new Splat Dualies and avoid getting splatted with the new Dodge Roll move. Mainstays like the Splat Roller and Splat Charger have been remixed to include new gameplay mechanics, and all special weapons are brand-new.
Local and Online Multiplayer - In a first for the series, compete in local multiplayer Turf War battles*, whether in TV mode or on-the-go in handheld or tabletop modes. Online battles also make a return**
New ways to play – Play with the Joy-Con™ controllers or the Nintendo Switch™ Pro Controller (sold separately), both of which support motion controls for better aiming

Work your way through the traps and devices inside, utilizing your runes and think outside the box to earn special items and other rewards that will help you on your adventure.
Be prepared and properly equipped – With an entire world waiting to be explored, you'll need a variety of outfits and gear to reach every corner.

You're surrounded, outnumbered and have to use any weapon you can get your hands on to dismantle your opponents in a flurry of kung fu. That's the essence of OFDP2, the world's fastest brawler. It features the original OFDP's unique two-button mechanics which we've spent the last five years perfecting. Speed and precision are key in this whirlwind fighting frenzy, as players maintain control over the 26 different unlockable skills, frenetic gameplay, and classic kung fu-inspired animations.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Having these skills available simultaneously is a major design challenge that encompasses the core of what OFDP2 is trying to achieve.

Explore dangerous corners of the procedurally generated world, take down titans of the mining industry, and harness the power of Sparklite!
Everything in the world of Geodia is tied together by Sparklite... it's the life force of the planet, and the inhabitants have learned how to channel it safely. The blue, glowing ore can be harnessed providing a low-level, rechargeable power source. Or, for those brave or greedy enough, it can be consumed for a surge of power with grave consequences. Geodia’s self-titled &quot;Baron&quot; has devised a plot to mine the world’s Sparklite core to meet his own ends. Mining Sparklite in large quantities, the Baron repurposes the ore to fuel his powerful war machines, but the pollution from the consumed Sparklite is corrupting the world. Animals have turned into violent monsters, and the environment is rotting away.
The stricken land of Geodia has a natural defence in its Sparklite core. Periodically, the core causes a Disruption which rearranges the world, setting back the Baron’s efforts. Our heroine, Ada, must stop the Baron before he can obtain the core and gain the power to create a new world in which he has ultimate power. A plucky mechanic, Ada will need to use her cunning and skills to defeat the Baron’s henchmen across five distinct zones. Ada will have to work with Geodia’s weird and wonderful inhabitants if she’s to face the Baron and put paid to his deadly plans before it’s too late.&nbsp;

There never quite seem to be enough bunny girls in the world, so here is another for you aficionados out there. This 2D sidescrolling exploration platformer follows the adventure of Erina, whose humdrum life as a regular rabbit is turned upside-down when she finds herself in an unknown world and turned into a human (with rabbit ears)!
Along the way she meets the cheerful pink-haired fairy, Ribbon, who mysteriously chooses to stay by Erina’s side.
These unwitting heroes embark together on their quest to restore Erina’s life to normalcy, but who knows what troubles lurk, waiting for them…
&nbsp;
●Explore! Plaform! Your own adventure!
Rabi-Ribi is a 2D exploration platformer that focuses on non-linear gameplay. There will be hints to guide the player along, but they’re never required to follow them, which allows for much greater freedom to—you guessed it—explore.
Players will play as our protagonist Erina, who focuses on close quarters combat. Ribbon the fairy is the ranged attacker who follows Erina’s lead, indirectly controlled by the player.
Erina may be a little rabbit that was turned into a human, but that doesn’t stop her from being capable of some pretty neat moves.
Both Erina and Ribbon’s abilities can be improved by learning new skills and attacks through collecting items and upgrades that are spread throughout the world.
What trinkets and skills to pick up is up to the player; dare you challenge hard mode without any items?

Use camels as trampolines, champagne bottles as cannons, balloons to lift objects, fireworks wheels to drive conveyor belts, magnets to attract metal objects, and many more gadgets to solve the puzzles and clear the levels.

+ Create an unlimited number of your own levels and challenge a friend to try to beat it.
+ Use a plethora of goofy gadgets from scissors to washing-line pegs.
+ Complete the levels in multiple ways...get as bonkers and creative as you like.
&nbsp;
Gameplay
On every level there are a number of objects and monsters...The goal is to rid the level of the monsters.
This can be achieved in different ways...The objects are affected by the laws of physics and play a key part in solving the puzzle. The objects form a “contraption” which are placed in such a way, which creates a chain reaction that will wipe out all monsters. The catch is that the contraption is broken - some objects are not in the right place. Your goal is to fix the contraption. You do this, by repositioning, flipping, or connecting the different objects.
When the level starts “time is frozen”, gravity doesn’t affect the objects and all machines or gadgets are not running. During this time you can move things around, connect things, flip things, in order to make the chain reaction work. Once you are done, you set things in motion (unfreeze time) by pressing the Play button and watch things play out.
If you did everything correctly the chain reaction will wipe out all monsters and you will progress to the next level. If your solution is not correct, you can pause the contraption and fiddle with the objects again.
&nbsp;
Gadgets
Some of the gadgets are activated by igniting them, other by touching, pushing or pulling them. Some gadgets work on their own, while other gadgets must be connected together to function. For example in order for the conveyor belt to turn, it must be connected to an active engine, using a belt. Likewise in order for the laser gun to fire a laser, the trigger must be connected with a rope, to a moving object, like a car.
&nbsp;
Objectives
There dozens of ways you can rid the levels of the monsters. It all depends on what objects are you presented with. The simplest way is if the monster is pushed off the edge of a platform and falls off the screen. Other ways include cutting a rope holding a heavy object, which will smash the monster; pulling a rope, connected to a laser gun; igniting the engine of a rocket with a lighter in which the monster is in, etc.
&nbsp;
The solution is achieved through chain reactions, Rube Goldberg style. For example: in order to shoot the monster with a laser, you might have to connect a rope to the trigger, the other end to a rocket. You will need to ignite the engine of the rocket, which will pull the rope, which will trigger the laser gun, which will ultimately eliminate the monster. The more you progress through the game, the more complex the new puzzles become.&nbsp;",1569600682033,contraptions-switch,/content/dam/noa/en_US/games/switch/c/contraptions-switch/Switch_Contraptions_box_eShop.png,/content/dam/noa/en_US/games/switch/c/contraptions-switch/screenshot-gallery/Switch_Contraptions_01.jpg,Nintendo Switch,2019-10-10T00:00:00.000-07:00,[],['Puzzle'],Everyone,[],na,['Online Play via Nintendo Switch Online'],[],[],['Funbox Media'],,1 player,False,False,"['Pre-purchase', 'Coming soon']",767ebe6c-36eb-3711-b089-5f7ca1f9a531,"{'title': {'value': 'Contraptions', 'matchLevel': 'none', 'matchedWords': []}, 'nsuid': {'value': '70010000018122', 'matchLevel': 'none', 'matchedWords': []}}",70010000018122,9.99,$5 - $9.99,,,

Psychology plays a huge role within the game: heroes and enemies are atypical and the line between good and evil is blurred. The plot is rich of unpredictable twists, but touching at the same time. The development of the game is similar to that of a film narration, where the player perfectly identifies himself with the character. The soundtrack, composed by Nobuko Toda and Luca Balboni, enhances the terrifying atmosphere of the game.

The story revolves around Rosemary Reed, a fascinating 35-year-old woman, who reaches Richard Felton’s house, in order to investigate on the disappearance of a girl called Celeste. The woman is greeted by Gloria, the nurse who takes care of old Richard. When Dr. Felton understands Rosemary’s true intentions, the dread begins.

&nbsp;
KEY FEATURES
Remothered: Tormented Fathers is the first title of the long-awaited 3rd person game trilogy. A web of lies where murders and obsessions come to life. A revolutionary experience created for survival horror fans.

- Many ways to survive - The endless combinations of game dynamics make the experience available to every gamer: stealth, action, strategic, hide ‘n run. Deceive your stalker and block him in another area of the house. Attack your enemy and make your items more powerful. Carefully study the behaviour of your stalker and his path. Don’t get too close to your enemy, act like an unperceivable shadow, hiding yourself from his sight. Or just mix these dynamics together.

- Psychological plot - Characters in the story are everyday people that turn themselves into scary monsters.

- Movie-like cutscenes - Thanks to his impressive direction, Chris Darril puts into play a story rich of complex life-like characters.
&nbsp;
Audio clues - Use the soundtrack and the 3D audio sound effects to understand when your stalkers are getting closer.
- No health bars - Your body is the only way to understand how you are doing.

- Realistic puzzles - Environments and characters have been conceived to be realistic and credible.

Will you demonize the new synthetic alcoholic drink, even though your boss stressed they are an important investor? Will you support current government, as tensions grow between the neighboring country?
After work, you emerge on the streets of Novistan, shaped by the very news you publish. Perhaps you will see more graffiti, angry bums or even a riot?

Will you agree to meet the clandestine group of truthtellers, or stop to watch the Prime Minister's speech?&nbsp;

On the way home you meet with three main characters: Evie, your co-worker and immigrant, worried about her health and growing xenophobic sentiment; your brother Justin, an aspiring comedian struggling with impostor syndrome and social anxiety; finally Rudy, a single father trying to provide for his little girl and keep his store afloat, while a mega-mart opens up next door.

Achieving success in league matches and winning first place requires continuous training. The whole team needs to obtain skills, not just a single player. Their proper use in a match is the key to victory, even with a stronger opponent.

The base where the team trains is very important for rapid development and achieving success. Expand it, share new premises and install additional items for use. The players must also train at the gym, play, relax and have meals. All these elements have a direct impact on the games in the league.

Before league matches conduct sparing with other teams, to prepare the appropriate tactics. In sparing you can test different combinations of Special Skills, select weapons, behavior and observe their impact on the game.

Start in Sponsored Tournaments to gain experience and earn cash prizes.

To reach the very top there is hard work and loads of matches to play.

In Eight-Minute Empire, 2-5 players take turns selecting a card from the six displayed. This card gives the player a resource, and also has an action which the player takes immediately. Actions help players take over the map, but the resources are worth points at the end of the game, so players have to balance the two aspects. Players spread across the map in order to collect points at the end of the game by having majority control in regions and continents.

Challenge yourself in the Hero’s Journey: individually tailored hero campaigns filled with puzzle rooms, skill challenges, and boss fights.

Friday the 13th: The Game will include a variety of kills, new and familiar, that will help you set the tone for the Jason Voorhees that you want to be. You’ll even get to unlock various Jason incarnations from the movies!

Playing as a counselor is all about risk and reward, giving players multiple means of triumph over Jason! Want to hide in the woods as you wait for the police? Perhaps you want to band together and try to take on Jason as a group? Maybe you and a friend decide to fix the boat on the lake and escape while leaving everyone else to their fate? There are endless opportunities to survive the night, but every choice has a consequence.&nbsp;

520,game,en_US,/games/detail/divine-ascent-switch,Divine Ascent,"Ages ago, the gods contacted several civilizations all around the world. But since then, they remained silent. Now they need to hear our calls.
Divine Ascent is a single and local-multiplayer strategy-puzzle game. The goal is to be the first to build towers, and to reach their tops to place temples.

Six of the biggest civilizations of the ancient times compete against each other, to be the one taken by the gods to the heavens. To this end, they've elected builders whose sole purpose is to erect monuments as high in the sky as possible.

Key Features:

&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; Arena (local-multiplayer) and Puzzles (single player) modes
&nbsp; &nbsp; Arena is a set of 24 multiplayer levels for two to six players (humans or A.I.)
&nbsp; &nbsp; Single player mode contains 30 puzzles with increasing difficulty, plus the final stage which is sort of an Arena level against 5 opponents
&nbsp; &nbsp; Special moves
&nbsp; &nbsp; Tile-based isometric 3D graphics
&nbsp; &nbsp; Each civilization has its own theme and atmospheric background sound design
&nbsp;
Game mechanics:
&nbsp;
The game is turn-based, in a board game style. The goal is to be the first to place three temples. A temple appears when you place a pawn on a tower five pieces high, or three pieces high in puzzle mode.
&nbsp;
The player begins by placing his pawn on any square located on the base floor. If there is no such available square, he must place it on the lowest free floor. You must place it again in the same way after making a temple appear.
&nbsp;
Each turn, the player has two move options:
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; The pawn can be moved orthogonally to another adjacent free square of the board, whether on the same floor, one floor higher, or one floor lower.
&nbsp; &nbsp; You can use the piece in the corner of the screen to add it on a free square of the board.
&nbsp;
Special moves:
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; If squares are free and orthogonally adjacent to each other, and form stairs of which the lower piece can be climbed by our pawn, we can directly climb to their top.
&nbsp; &nbsp; If a square is located in front of ours orthogonally, our pawn can jump on it provided that it's one floor higher, and that every floor between is lower.
&nbsp; &nbsp; If the four squares around our pawn are blocked by whether pawns, temples, pieces that are at least two floors higher, or the edge of the board, you can place a new piece under it.
&nbsp;
There are squares with special properties for each location. It's up to you to discover which effects the gods have awarded them.
&nbsp;
Game modes:
&nbsp;
There are two game modes: Arena and Puzzles.
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; Arena is a set of 24 multiplayer levels, taking place in the locations of all the different civilizations and using their particular special squares. Two to six players (humans or A.I.) compete to build temples.
&nbsp; &nbsp; Puzzles mode is a scripted solo adventure where you have to solve several levels to advance to the next ones. The player has a limited amount of moves to build a single temple, whether alone or against opponents in later stages.",1569957018124,divine-ascent-switch,/content/dam/noa/en_US/games/switch/d/divine-ascent-switch/Switch_DivineAscent_box_eShop.png,gxNjk4aTE6EWcz6qxmswIr5ZQW2xb3fZ,Nintendo Switch,2019-07-25T00:00:00.000-07:00,[],"['Board Game', 'Multiplayer', 'Strategy', 'Puzzle']",Everyone,[],na,[],[],"['4+', '3+', '2+', '1+']",['Timothee Paez'],['Absorb Reality'],up to 6 players,False,False,['Available now'],33cd2676-319c-3ce4-b764-fa534f2f71c9,"{'title': {'value': 'Divine Ascent', 'matchLevel': 'none', 'matchedWords': []}, 'nsuid': {'value': '70010000014960', 'matchLevel': 'none', 'matchedWords': []}}",70010000014960,4.99,$0 - $4.99,,,

There is a current generator on each of the boards, linked to the fan through a path. Problem is, the path is broken in several places!
To ensure that the current reaches the fan uninterrupted, you must create an electric arc wherever the circuit was damaged.
&nbsp;
Seems complicated? Don't worry. No electrical know-how is required!
&nbsp;
You just need to skillfully operate a metal ball and build electric arcs with it where needed. It's quite simple and intuitive.

Bear in mind that with each board comes with new challenges. Always start by planning your next move, then carefully execute it.

Good luck!

Dance with Death

In the tight confines of the space freighter, standing still is not an option. Your ability to dodge around enemies is as important as your aim. Survival requires quick thinking and rapid reflexes and a true master of the dance is a beautiful thing to behold.
Different Every Time

Each single screen level is randomised, drawing on a pool of platform layouts, objective types and enemies as well as which vending machines will be present. You’ll never know which weapons or grenades will spawn in the vending machines whilst crate drops containing special abilities, sidearms, perks and defense moves are also random, adding further to the mind-boggling possible combinations.

Each story you find lets you experience the life of a new family member on the day of their death, with stories ranging from the distant past to the present day.

The gameplay and tone of the stories are as varied as the Finches themselves. The only constants are that each is played from a first-person perspective and that each story ends with that family member's death.

593,game,en_US,/games/detail/pure-mahjong-switch,Pure Mahjong,"The Story&nbsp;
Many people equate China with the lunar calendar, but the sun has also played a pivotal role in how the Chinese view life cycles. The ancient Chinese developed what is known as the 24 solar terms, which prescribed how people lived and worked, especially in rural areas. The solar terms originated between the 16th and 11th centuries BC and were perfected in their present form during the Western Han Dynasty (206-220 BC). Pure Mahjong explores each of these 24 solar terms over the course of the year – both the main screen and the game itself adjust to the season, displaying typical motifs and objects along with some interesting trivia.&nbsp; &nbsp;

Design: a completely new approach with amazing results&nbsp;

Every picture you see in Pure Mahjong is a lovingly created collage based on real photographs. Nothing like this has ever been used in a computer game, and the experience for the player is something completely different from the pixelated effects that pop up in even the latest titles.&nbsp;

Each of the 24 seasons (called solar terms) has been created as a work of art, combining amazing and traditional sights from all over China according to the season. 
While the main screen introduces the current season, the Mahjong games themselves are displayed on 24 beautifully decorated changing backgrounds.&nbsp;
Levels: Intelligent entertainment that can last minutes or hours 
With more than 1,000 individually designed levels, Pure Mahjong provides enough variety for months of challenging gameplay. While some levels can be solved in minutes, other may take hours to finally crack. There is a solution for every single level.&nbsp;
As a special feature, you can compare your personal results with those of other players that have solved each individual level before you.&nbsp;
On every single day of the year, four new levels await you to be solved. From (relatively) easy to very difficult, players can expect real challenges. For each solved level, the player is awarded with a calorie-free fortune cookie. More than 700 different messages await discovery!&nbsp;

Music: A relaxing, uplifting soundtrack&nbsp;

We’ve listened to hundreds of relaxing Chinese-themed songs for close to a year to create a soundtrack of more than 20 inspiring, unobtrusive tracks. The result is beautiful music that not only helps you concentrate and relax, but also completes the meditative experience of playing Pure Mahjong and stimulates your senses.&nbsp;
Natively created for Nintendo Switch™
Pure Mahjong and its amazing visuals is without doubt a game for the big screen. Plus, its integrated screensaver will make you never want to switch it off. Our team has spent a lot of time making the gameplay and selection of tiles as easy and native as possible using even one Joy-Con™. However, the handheld mode is no less fun, and the game is a delight to play with the touch screen.&nbsp;
Bonus: The most beautiful screensaver&nbsp;

My new adventure, Leisure Suit Larry - Wet Dreams Don’t Dry, takes me – whatever the route or twist of fate – from the end of the ’80s directly into the 21st century and wow, how the world has changed! While my view of the world and women from way back in the 1980s collides with modern reality harder than the breasts of a lusciously stacked blonde jogging along a beach, I’m all set to date my way across the modern world!&nbsp;
In a “point &amp; click” adventure I’d call typical for the genre we mutually experience how I fall head-over-heels in love with Faith, the hot-to-trot assistant to the boss at Prune, a technology enterprise successful worldwide. Since even dating is done digitally nowadays, the first thing I have to do is to work on my score at Timber, the totally hip, can’t-get-anywhere-without-it dating app where I date women, satisfy their needs, and accordingly pick up points for my Timber profile. And whenever I get a chance in between, always briefly check out a few new bikini pix at Instacrap – the 21st century is gnarly smill!

Features:

• Leisure Suit Larry is coming in the 21st century – and no, there’s no word missing here

• Explore a lovingly designed, non-linear game world set in the modern world with over 30 handdrawn venues

• Use “Timber”, the ingame app, along with an innovative dating mechanism to date women, consequently improve your score at Timber, and ultimately clear the way to get to Faith, the women of your dreams

In this world, mysterious objects called &quot;Remnants&quot; have existed since ancient times. Who created these objects? When? And for what reason? No one knew nor had the means to know, but continued to extract and use their colossal power.
However, the Remnants' immense power gradually caused the world to fall out of balance. As further separation tore apart those who rule and those who follow, a war broke out―the beginning of a long and endless strife.
A thousand years later, this story begins.

CAPITAL LIST LEADHERBOARDS - The primary goal is to get a high score, however the only way to keep your score is to extract with it. You cannot play till death. If you die, not only do you wipe your current score, you risk the chance of wiping your leaderboard position as well. How you ask? The lower your health the higher the bonus the greater the risk. Every time you extract your score is marked. Why you ask? Why not?

SPLIT SCREEN SINGLE PLAYER TWIN STICK RISK ‘EM UP - You will be controlling two ships simultaneously. The devil is in the details. The left side is invincible, however shooting and moving consumes your LINK. In order to restore it you must recover MATERIAL on the right side. MATERIAL multiplies your overall score so use it with absolute discretion. On the right side you are recovering resources and will need 12 PARTS to extract and mark your leaderboard position. Don’t doubt yourself. Push yourself. You will be rewarded and you will be tested.

TEARS - Each Tear consists of new challenges with hella bonuses attached to them. Focus, overcome, and survive.

If you want a challenge you came to the right place.

Step into the shoes of Sir Albert Wickes and The Right Honourable Clarence Baxter, two 19th century explorers who have chosen to pilot the HMS Fearful on its maiden voyage to Mars.

When the steam engine runs out of coal, the ship's cat shreds the navigation chart, and the tea gets cold, it becomes clear that interstellar transportation isn't a walk in the park. It will take the talents of two players working together on the problems that arise to get to Mars in one piece.

· LOCAL CO-OP ·

39 Days to Mars is a two player co-operative game.&nbsp; The HMS Fearful is a masterpiece of unreliable engineering, therefore Albert and Baxter will need all the help they can get. Nothing can be done without the effort of both players, who have important roles to play in the adventure.
· SINGLEPLAYER AI ·

For the solo voyager, the ship's computer-controlled cat will keep you company. Without a second pair of hands, Albert will need an extra dose of dexterity to navigate the challenges of Victorian space flight.
· BITE-SIZED ADVENTURES ·

The mix of action and thoughtful puzzles make it perfect for playing in short sessions. The entire adventure fits comfortably into an evening, or a long tea break.
· ATMOSPHERIC ·

Years after taking Stilwater for their own, the Third Street Saints have evolved from street gang to household brand name, with Saints sneakers, Saints energy drinks and Johnny Gat bobblehead dolls all available at a store near you.&nbsp; The Saints are kings of Stilwater, but their celebrity status has not gone unnoticed.&nbsp; The Syndicate, a legendary criminal fraternity with pawns in play all over the globe, has turned its eye on the Saints and demands tribute.
Refusing to kneel to the Syndicate, you take the fight to Steelport, a once-proud metropolis reduced to a struggling city of sin under Syndicate control.&nbsp; Take a tank skydiving, call in a satellite-targeted airstrike on a Mexican wrestling gang, and defend yourself against a highly-trained military force using only a sex toy in the most outlandish gameplay scenarios ever seen.

Come for gorgeous hand-drawn art, and stay for a thoughtful, fully-voiced tale of intrigue &amp; tragedy featuring Matthew Mercer, Jennifer Hale and more.
In the turmoil-ridden city of Ombre, religion holds no sway; only the songs sung of one’s deeds will carry an Ombrian’s legacy beyond death. To ensure their songs live on, the warring guildsmen of the city will go to sinister lengths to acquire Mascherines - masks that grant their wielders the power to channel the elements and cast destructive magic.&nbsp;

Explore the city’s chaos as the investigator Cicero Gavar, who was exiled for a crime against the state five years ago. Now summoned back to Ombre to solve the mysterious kidnapping of a diplomat, Cicero finds himself surrounded by doubtful and deceitful characters as he works to unearth a deeper conspiracy within the shadows of this Mascherine-mad city.

The game has an isometric view on the level, which stands out from the typical for this genre top-down or side view and adds some depth to the environment. The graphics are simple yet eye-catching, with lots of stuff happening on screen. There's no room for boredom.&nbsp;

Key features include most of what you'd expect to see in an arcade shooter: fluid controls, a variety of enemies, power-ups, changing environments, player progression, score, and more.

Do you dare to be the one man army?!

822,game,en_US,/games/detail/shadows-of-adam-switch,Shadows of Adam,"Tucked away from the outside world by the impenetrable haze of the Misty Woods, the village of Adam has mostly lived in peace since the days of the Wraith War. The dark power that fueled that war has vanished, but darkness is descending once more and Adam's legendary hero, Orazio, is no more.&nbsp;
10 years ago he left without explanation and never returned, leaving his son and adopted daughter to wrestle with the dark secret he left behind—a secret that must now be revealed if the children hope to save both Adam and their departed father, though its revelation could unhinge the world.&nbsp;

Shadows of Adam is a creative, humorous and exciting take on the 16-bit JRPG era, but with its own twists and style for the modern day gamer. Fast-paced battles, gorgeous graphics, an awesome soundtrack and the convenience to save anywhere you like make it tough to resist! Whether playing on the TV or in handheld mode, the game’s glorious pixels will immerse you in the adventure and its memorable scenes.

Features:

• Compelling Character Driven Story: Shadows of Adam’s story is one with a deep narrative and an interesting plot. The story revolves around 4 main characters: Asrael, Kellan, Curtis and Talon.

• A Strategic AP Management Battle System: AP is restored between each round of battle automatically and through defeating enemies. This allows a unique attrition system that encourages skill use and fast combat.
• Beautiful Visuals: Shadows of Adam features beautifully modernized visuals inspired by classic JRPGs of the '90s.
• Original Soundtrack With Over 44 Tracks: An original soundtrack by Tyler Mire that’s inspired by music from the genre's greatest games. This soundtrack includes unique themes for each area and character and has an emphasis on strong melodies and an emotional connection.",1569957018124,shadows-of-adam-switch,/content/dam/noa/en_US/games/switch/s/shadows-of-adam-switch/Switch_ShadowsOfAdam_box_eShop.png,00a2lwaDE6k4cqwy2AcGhOH5Su6Cyi-o,Nintendo Switch,2019-05-03T00:00:00.000-07:00,[],"['Adventure', 'Role-Playing']",Teen,"['Alcohol Reference', 'Fantasy Violence', 'Language', 'Partial Nudity']",na,['Deals'],[],[],['CIRCLE Ent.'],,1 player,False,False,['Available now'],2df50303-114e-3765-9e62-23be24a7b84a,"{'title': {'value': 'Shadows of Adam', 'matchLevel': 'none', 'matchedWords': []}, 'nsuid': {'value': '70010000017869', 'matchLevel': 'none', 'matchedWords': []}, 'salePrice': {'value': '11.99', 'matchLevel': 'none', 'matchedWords': []}}",70010000017869,14.99,$10 - $19.99,11.99,,

      of freedom, soaring the skies as a Sky Pirate.

      vows revenge on the empire, and secretly leads a resistance in the hopes 
      of restoring her homeland.

THE DETAILS

Play both Game Modes:

Bone Hunt – The roguelike treasure hunt. Dig for bones across four worlds of increasing difficulty. Battle enemies above perilous cliffs and sunken desert caves. Die a lot.

Free Dig – An endless digging experience. Dig through an infinite set of levels with minor challenge and no game overs. Progress is saved.

• Forge your own path as you creatively tunnel through each level.

• Travel to new worlds! Uncover stranger and more dangerous environments.
• Hunt for bones and treasure as you dive deeper.
• Discover shops and buy items, but don't get too greedy!
• Keep sniffing out bones to unlock a variety of color themes.
• A thumpin’ 8-bit soundtrack you’ll surely dig.
A WORD FROM THE DEVELOPER

Each time you play Dig Dog, the levels are freshly generated. Of course the worlds get steadily harder, but as you dig more you’ll discover a variety of challenges and goals. Will you spend your coins on a helpful item at the shop in 1-3 or horde them in an attempt for a high score. Maybe you’ll try to unlock new Warp Bones or try and beat all 4 worlds without dying.

Or maybe just chill out in Free Dig mode with some cathartic digging. I love destructive environments. You can pretty much dig up a whole level if you want. (Although that can be quite dangerous.)

As you dig more, you may start to find some of the game’s hidden depths. For instance, if you fast stomp on an enemy you’ll create sparks that ripple to the left and right. These sparks are both useful and dangerous. It depends on when and how you use them.

On a personal note, Dig Dog was the first game I've programmed and drawn without using my hands. It was a challenge to make the game this way and I'm quite relieved that it's now complete.

I hope you enjoy Dig Dog. I think there’s a lot to uncover here!

He is part of the lowest social class, doomed to live his life in literal mountains of trash. He hopes for an opportunity to get into the world of the rich, who live in a floating city high above the clouds. Fate seems to smile on the snotty good-for-nothing when one day the attractive lady named Goal from the higher sector plummets into one of the trash heaps. Rufus decides to help the young woman out by taking her back to her husband. When he notices that Goal's husband is a dead ringer for himself, he hatches a diabolical scheme to gain access to the upper world. However, things don't work out quite as planned, since he has feelings for the beauty which limits his usual unscrupulousness.

Help Rufus, the poor boy from the junkyard, to win over the girl from heaven. Only with this rich girl from his dreams he might be able to escape Deponia and, unexpectedly, to save the planet.

Getting together with friends, fighting bosses—that’s all cool, but having some time for yourself is pretty awesome too.
There are times we like to spend some time alone having fun, and taking on challenges in a game is an awesome way to do just that.
ALPHA, the latest work by KANAME, is a simple game. There are no additional in-game purchases: once it's yours, you can begin tackling it until you reach the end. Maybe it’s time to take a break from playing games for other people.

◆ Key features of ALPHA

◎　A single-player action shooting game. Quite a challenging one, in fact.

◎　Average play time of 2 hours (or, if you like to spend more time, as long as you want)
◎　Knock off enemy bullets with your sword to shoot and slash your way through stages.
◎　No save points during stages. Enemies are tough, and so are the bosses. Study their moves and work around them.
◎　When it’s game over, you start over from the beginning of the stage. You won’t be getting it easy!
◎　Some health items, shields, bombs, etc. are just a few useful items.

So enjoy studying and learn how to use Japanese writing with style!
&lt;Learning contents&gt;
• Understand the meaning and pronunciation of kanji displayed on the screen, and gradually learn it as you practice writing it repeatedly and correctly until it becomes second nature.
• By understanding the kanji by looking at the different parts and meanings that make up a single kanji, you will be able to understand the kanji completely.

“The name’s Greco! I live in the Hall of Kanji. Kanji are stylish and cool looking characters used in Japanese writing. There’s no doubt that you will become popular with the people of Japan if you learn them! In my hall of kanji you can do two types of study challenges against my ghosts. The first one is called the “Writing Challenge”. In this challenge a ghost will appear with a kanji inside of it. If you write the kanji in his stomach correctly many times, you will defeat the ghost. The second challenge is called the “Hide and Seek Challenge”. In this challenge, parts of a kanji are hidden behind many mirrors, can you guess what the kanji is by looking at just parts of it? If so, then write them as fast and as accurately as possible and get rid of the ghosts. The more ghosts you defeat, the closer you will get to solving the secret of my mystery puzzle. Writing kanji correctly many times is the best way to learn Japanese kanji. So good luck!”
--------------------------------------
• [Writing Challenge] – Write the kanji displayed on the ghost over and over again as accurately as possible.
• [Hide and Seek Challenge] – Some parts of the kanji are obstructed, and the visible parts can only by seen in a series of mirrors on the screen. From what you can see, try to guess and write the correct kanji.

      -Scenario-
    
    
      Long ago, when gods lived amongst people...
    
    
      
    
    
      There lived a swordsman who was given five swords forged by god himself.
    
    
      
    
    
      Using these swords, the swordsman brought peace and order to the world.
    
    
      
    
    
      People called the swordsman, &quot;Wielder of the Five Swords&quot;...
    
    
      
    
    
      One day, during a fete to praise the gods, the blades of the swordsman 
      turn against the gods for reasons unknown.
    
    
      
    
    
      One of the gods, Ozone, furious with all his powers, sealed the 
      swordsman away at the top of a mountain now known as Swords Peak.
    
    
      
    
    
      This tale begins 5,000 years after the battle between the two, near a 
      the small village of Cardina.

      through 16 locations in the bazaar. In each such a location, you can 
      carry out a specific action. The challenge, however, is that to take an 
      action, you must move your merchant and an assistant there, then leave 
      the assistant behind to handle all the details while you focus on larger 
      matters. If you want to use that assistant again later, your merchant 
      must return to that location to pick him up. Thus, you must plan ahead

995,game,en_US,/games/detail/rogue-bit-switch,Rogue Bit,"A single bit of computer memory became sentient and decided to escape 
      from digital into the real world. Explore RAM, modify bytes and hack 
      machine code and CPU registers to set it free.
    
    
      
    
    
      The game is about the way computers work internally. Having some 
      programming knowledge makes the game easier, but it isn't required. All 
      the elements required to solve the puzzles are explained in the game.
    
    
      
    
    
      How does it play?
    
    
      
    
    
      You play the game as a single bit of computer memory. You can invade 
      other bytes around you and thus modify their values. The game features 
      various types of puzzles:
    
    
      
    
    
      1. Explore
    
    
      
    
    
      With ability to XOR into adjacent bytes, you can navigate your way 
      through existing data in the memory. The game automatically marks the 
      bytes you cannot go through without getting yourself overwritten and 
      prevents you entering those. Both binary and ASCII views are available, 
      which you can utilize to find an open path for a particular puzzle.
    
    
      
    
    
      2. Decipher programs
    
    
      
    
    
      Various programs run on the computer you are trying to escape from. The 
      game includes a disassembler showing you the assembly language 
      corresponding to the machine code that is being executed. Don't worry if 
      you don't know any Assembly. There are only a handful of CPU 
      instructions and they are introduced gradually as you complete the 
      puzzles. Reading the assembly code, you can track the program logic, see 
      which parts of RAM it reads and writes to and manipulate data in those 
      locations to get the program to do what you want.
    
    
      
    
    
      3. Invade CPU registers
    
    
      
    
    
      The computer you are trying to escape has a simple CPU with a couple of 
      registers. You can trick the CPU to load yourself into the registers and 
      affect code execution or offload yourself into otherwise unreachable 
      memory locations.
    
    
      
    
    
      4. Hack
    
    
      
    
    
      For some puzzles, it isn't enough to change the data in RAM or 
      registers. You can also change the machine code to get the computer to 
      do different things.
    
    
      
    
    
      Gameplay Tips:
    
    
      
    
    
      Carefully observe the bytes on the screen and what the CPU is doing. 
      Sometimes you need to read the code in straightforward manner. Sometimes 
      you need to work your way backwards: find the line of the code you want 
      executed and then trace the code backwards to figure out how to trick 
      the CPU to get to that instruction.
    
    
      
    
    
      The game only has about 30 puzzles, but some of those might take 
      considerable effort to solve. So take it easy and don't rush to the end. 
      If you solve a puzzle by accident, don't go forward until you understand 
      why it happened. You might miss some small detail and get completely 
      stuck on the next puzzle.",1569957018124,rogue-bit-switch,/content/dam/noa/en_US/games/switch/r/rogue-bit-switch/Switch_RogueBit_box_eShop.png,EyMjllaDE6VWsdfyjUyOoBfCHKcOIzUv,Nintendo Switch,2019-03-21T00:00:00.000Z,[],"['Puzzle', 'Education', 'Simulation', 'Adventure']",Everyone,[],na,[],[],[],['Bigosaur'],,1 player,False,False,['Available now'],d2bd6474-03c5-375b-812d-6309f61f66fc,"{'title': {'value': 'Rogue Bit', 'matchLevel': 'none', 'matchedWords': []}, 'id': {'value': 'bO2_kbjEKl30ik4epzLteU8Mj8IO622t', 'matchLevel': 'none', 'matchedWords': []}, 'nsuid': {'value': '70010000018132', 'matchLevel': 'none', 'matchedWords': []}}",70010000018132,4.99,$0 - $4.99,,bO2_kbjEKl30ik4epzLteU8Mj8IO622t,
