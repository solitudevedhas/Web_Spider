Use your puzzle skills to eliminate pesky viruses!

Match capsules with viruses and watch them disappear! Simply match three objects of the same color vertically or horizontally to clear them.
Luckily, Dr. Mario and friends have virus-busting skills, and you can use leftover half-capsules to strategically zero in on especially meddlesome viruses.
Take your time, because each puzzling configuration of viruses must be cleared using a limited number of capsules. Keep calm to plan your approach, and you'll rid the Dr. Mario's world of viruses in no time!

Paging Dr. Mario!

A colorful cast of viruses has Dr. Mario's world in a panic! Dr. Mario and friends have put on lab coats and grabbed capsules! Now they're ready to eliminate those unruly viruses.
Dr. Mario isn't the only one on call—Dr. Peach, Dr. Bowser, and others are on duty. Staff up with assistants like Goomba, Koopa Troopa, and Buzzy Beetle to help your doctors out with additional skills.
Doctors and assistants have various virus-busting skills, so experiment to find a combination that suits your style and pace.
Hundreds of stages over many different worlds are ready for you to save! New worlds, new doctors, and more will be delivered on a regular basis.

Play together with friends and family around the world!

You're not in this alone—send and receive stamina-giving hearts to use in stage mode! Then, show off your puzzle-solving progress.

Everything in the world of Geodia is tied together by Sparklite... it's the life force of the planet, and the inhabitants have learned how to channel it safely. The blue, glowing ore can be harnessed providing a low-level, rechargeable power source. Or, for those brave or greedy enough, it can be consumed for a surge of power with grave consequences.

Animals have turned into violent monsters, and the environment is rotting away.
The stricken land of Geodia has a natural defence in its Sparklite core. Periodically, the core causes a Disruption which rearranges the world, setting back the Baron’s efforts. Our heroine, Ada, must stop the Baron before he can obtain the core and gain the power to create a new world in which he has ultimate power. A plucky mechanic, Ada will need to use her cunning and skills to defeat the Baron’s henchmen across five distinct zones.

There never quite seem to be enough bunny girls in the world, so here is another for you aficionados out there. This 2D sidescrolling exploration platformer follows the adventure of Erina, whose humdrum life as a regular rabbit is turned upside-down when she finds herself in an unknown world and turned into a human (with rabbit ears)!
Along the way she meets the cheerful pink-haired fairy, Ribbon, who mysteriously chooses to stay by Erina’s side.
These unwitting heroes embark together on their quest to restore Erina’s life to normalcy, but who knows what troubles lurk, waiting for them…

●Explore! Plaform! Your own adventure!
Rabi-Ribi is a 2D exploration platformer that focuses on non-linear gameplay. There will be hints to guide the player along, but they’re never required to follow them, which allows for much greater freedom to—you guessed it—explore.
Players will play as our protagonist Erina, who focuses on close quarters combat. Ribbon the fairy is the ranged attacker who follows Erina’s lead, indirectly controlled by the player.
Erina may be a little rabbit that was turned into a human, but that doesn’t stop her from being capable of some pretty neat moves.
Both Erina and Ribbon’s abilities can be improved by learning new skills and attacks through collecting items and upgrades that are spread throughout the world.
What trinkets and skills to pick up is up to the player; dare you challenge hard mode without any items?

Psychology plays a huge role within the game: heroes and enemies are atypical and the line between good and evil is blurred. The plot is rich of unpredictable twists, but touching at the same time. The development of the game is similar to that of a film narration, where the player perfectly identifies himself with the character. The soundtrack, composed by Nobuko Toda and Luca Balboni, enhances the terrifying atmosphere of the game.

The story revolves around Rosemary Reed, a fascinating 35-year-old woman, who reaches Richard Felton’s house, in order to investigate on the disappearance of a girl called Celeste. The woman is greeted by Gloria, the nurse who takes care of old Richard. When Dr. Felton understands Rosemary’s true intentions, the dread begins.

&nbsp; &nbsp; Single player mode contains 30 puzzles with increasing difficulty, plus the final stage which is sort of an Arena level against 5 opponents
&nbsp; &nbsp; Special moves
&nbsp; &nbsp; Tile-based isometric 3D graphics
&nbsp; &nbsp; Each civilization has its own theme and atmospheric background sound design
&nbsp;
Game mechanics:
&nbsp;
The game is turn-based, in a board game style. The goal is to be the first to place three temples. A temple appears when you place a pawn on a tower five pieces high, or three pieces high in puzzle mode.
&nbsp;
The player begins by placing his pawn on any square located on the base floor. If there is no such available square, he must place it on the lowest free floor. You must place it again in the same way after making a temple appear.
&nbsp;
Each turn, the player has two move options:
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; The pawn can be moved orthogonally to another adjacent free square of the board, whether on the same floor, one floor higher, or one floor lower.
&nbsp; &nbsp; You can use the piece in the corner of the screen to add it on a free square of the board.
&nbsp;
Special moves:
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; If squares are free and orthogonally adjacent to each other, and form stairs of which the lower piece can be climbed by our pawn, we can directly climb to their top.
&nbsp; &nbsp; If a square is located in front of ours orthogonally, our pawn can jump on it provided that it's one floor higher, and that every floor between is lower.
&nbsp; &nbsp; If the four squares around our pawn are blocked by whether pawns, temples, pieces that are at least two floors higher, or the edge of the board, you can place a new piece under it.
&nbsp;
There are squares with special properties for each location. It's up to you to discover which effects the gods have awarded them.
&nbsp;
Game modes:
&nbsp;
There are two game modes: Arena and Puzzles.
&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; Arena is a set of 24 multiplayer levels, taking place in the locations of all the different civilizations and using their particular special squares. Two to six players (humans or A.I.) compete to build temples.
&nbsp; &nbsp; Puzzles mode is a scripted solo adventure where you have to solve several levels to advance to the next ones. The player has a limited amount of moves to build a single temple, whether alone or against opponents in later stages.",4.99,Divine Ascent,/games/detail/divine-ascent-switch,,up to 6 players,33cd2676-319c-3ce4-b764-fa534f2f71c9,Nintendo Switch,'Timothee Paez',na,False,divine-ascent-switch

Dance with Death

In the tight confines of the space freighter, standing still is not an option. Your ability to dodge around enemies is as important as your aim. Survival requires quick thinking and rapid reflexes and a true master of the dance is a beautiful thing to behold.
Different Every Time

Many people equate China with the lunar calendar, but the sun has also played a pivotal role in how the Chinese view life cycles. The ancient Chinese developed what is known as the 24 solar terms, which prescribed how people lived and worked, especially in rural areas. The solar terms originated between the 16th and 11th centuries BC and were perfected in their present form during the Western Han Dynasty (206-220 BC). Pure Mahjong explores each of these 24 solar terms over the course of the year – both the main screen and the game itself adjust to the season, displaying typical motifs and objects along with some interesting trivia.&nbsp; &nbsp;

Design: a completely new approach with amazing results&nbsp;

Every picture you see in Pure Mahjong is a lovingly created collage based on real photographs. Nothing like this has ever been used in a computer game, and the experience for the player is something completely different from the pixelated effects that pop up in even the latest titles.&nbsp;

Each of the 24 seasons (called solar terms) has been created as a work of art, combining amazing and traditional sights from all over China according to the season. 
While the main screen introduces the current season, the Mahjong games themselves are displayed on 24 beautifully decorated changing backgrounds.&nbsp;
Levels: Intelligent entertainment that can last minutes or hours 
With more than 1,000 individually designed levels, Pure Mahjong provides enough variety for months of challenging gameplay. While some levels can be solved in minutes, other may take hours to finally crack. There is a solution for every single level.&nbsp;
As a special feature, you can compare your personal results with those of other players that have solved each individual level before you.&nbsp;
On every single day of the year, four new levels await you to be solved. From (relatively) easy to very difficult, players can expect real challenges. For each solved level, the player is awarded with a calorie-free fortune cookie. More than 700 different messages await discovery!&nbsp;

Music: A relaxing, uplifting soundtrack&nbsp;

We’ve listened to hundreds of relaxing Chinese-themed songs for close to a year to create a soundtrack of more than 20 inspiring, unobtrusive tracks. The result is beautiful music that not only helps you concentrate and relax, but also completes the meditative experience of playing Pure Mahjong and stimulates your senses.&nbsp;
Natively created for Nintendo Switch™
Pure Mahjong and its amazing visuals is without doubt a game for the big screen. Plus, its integrated screensaver will make you never want to switch it off. Our team has spent a lot of time making the gameplay and selection of tiles as easy and native as possible using even one Joy-Con™. However, the handheld mode is no less fun, and the game is a delight to play with the touch screen.&nbsp;
Bonus: The most beautiful screensaver&nbsp;
Over several months, we’ve collected and licensed hundreds of amazing super high-resolution photographs, covering nature, customs, architecture, food and many other topics that reflect today’s China. The collection really is amazing, and it can be enjoyed by those who connect their Nintendo Switch™ console to their big-screen TV. Our entire team now uses this screensaver with the relaxing soundtrack on their TVs at home.",9.99,Pure Mahjong,/games/detail/pure-mahjong-switch,,1 player,9a60432f-16e9-37d3-8ec2-967b07c815fc,Nintendo Switch,'the binary family',na,False,pure-mahjong-switch

There exists a world woven together by four races: Mitra, Yama, Qsiti, and Sovani.
In this world, mysterious objects called &quot;Remnants&quot; have existed since ancient times. Who created these objects? When? And for what reason? No one knew nor had the means to know, but continued to extract and use their colossal power.
However, the Remnants' immense power gradually caused the world to fall out of balance. As further separation tore apart those who rule and those who follow, a war broke out―the beginning of a long and endless strife.
A thousand years later, this story begins.
■ Distinct Battle System
A command-style battle with ever-changing scenarios
Coming in contact with enemies on the field will trigger battles. Strategize and make full use of the commands that change constantly depending on the positions and state of friendly and enemy forces.
Morale of friendly forces greatly affects the outcome of battle
In battle, morale expresses the spirit of individuals and groups of both friendly and enemy forces. Higher morale has advantageous effects such as increasing the attack stat to deal more damage, or decreasing damage dealt by the enemy.",19.99,THE LAST REMNANT Remastered,/games/detail/the-last-remnant-remastered-switch,,1 player,f1c038f5-2ef5-30b6-923a-31019b411286,Nintendo Switch,'Square Enix',na,False,the-last-remnant-remastered-switch

When the steam engine runs out of coal, the ship's cat shreds the navigation chart, and the tea gets cold, it becomes clear that interstellar transportation isn't a walk in the park. It will take the talents of two players working together on the problems that arise to get to Mars in one piece.

Bone Hunt – The roguelike treasure hunt. Dig for bones across four worlds of increasing difficulty. Battle enemies above perilous cliffs and sunken desert caves. Die a lot.

Free Dig – An endless digging experience. Dig through an infinite set of levels with minor challenge and no game overs. Progress is saved.

A WORD FROM THE DEVELOPER

Each time you play Dig Dog, the levels are freshly generated. Of course the worlds get steadily harder, but as you dig more you’ll discover a variety of challenges and goals. Will you spend your coins on a helpful item at the shop in 1-3 or horde them in an attempt for a high score. Maybe you’ll try to unlock new Warp Bones or try and beat all 4 worlds without dying.

Or maybe just chill out in Free Dig mode with some cathartic digging. I love destructive environments. You can pretty much dig up a whole level if you want. (Although that can be quite dangerous.)

As you dig more, you may start to find some of the game’s hidden depths. For instance, if you fast stomp on an enemy you’ll create sparks that ripple to the left and right. These sparks are both useful and dangerous. It depends on when and how you use them.

On a personal note, Dig Dog was the first game I've programmed and drawn without using my hands. It was a challenge to make the game this way and I'm quite relieved that it's now complete.

I hope you enjoy Dig Dog. I think there’s a lot to uncover here!

In Deponia, the world has degenerated into a vast garbage dump, in which the crotchety Rufus ekes out his sorry existence. He is part of the lowest social class, doomed to live his life in literal mountains of trash. He hopes for an opportunity to get into the world of the rich, who live in a floating city high above the clouds. Fate seems to smile on the snotty good-for-nothing when one day the attractive lady named Goal from the higher sector plummets into one of the trash heaps. Rufus decides to help the young woman out by taking her back to her husband. When he notices that Goal's husband is a dead ringer for himself, he hatches a diabolical scheme to gain access to the upper world. However, things don't work out quite as planned, since he has feelings for the beauty which limits his usual unscrupulousness.

Help Rufus, the poor boy from the junkyard, to win over the girl from heaven. Only with this rich girl from his dreams he might be able to escape Deponia and, unexpectedly, to save the planet.

      In our 2018 digital version we have maintained all of the features that 
      made Istanbul the fan favorite that it is, but also expanded upon it 
      with a number of tools and features only available on the digital 
      platform. We maintained the authentic board game feeling with the 
      convenience you can expect from an electronic device.
    
    
      
    
    
      So what is the game about?
    
    
      
    
    
      Can you be the first merchant to collect a certain number of rubies?

      In Istanbul, you lead a group of one merchant and his four assistants 
      through 16 locations in the bazaar. In each such a location, you can 
      carry out a specific action. The challenge, however, is that to take an 
      action, you must move your merchant and an assistant there, then leave 
      the assistant behind to handle all the details while you focus on larger 
      matters. If you want to use that assistant again later, your merchant 
      must return to that location to pick him up. Thus, you must plan ahead 
      carefully to avoid being left with no assistants and thus unable to do 
      anything&#8230;

Experience the yet-untold story of Jason and Eve after defeating Earth's mutant scourge as they venture into the depths of space in their new battle tank, &quot;GAIA-SOPHIA&quot;!
&nbsp;
The story of Blaster Master Zero 2 begins a few months after the events of the first game (released on March 9, 2017), where the main protagonist Jason saves planet Earth from the mutants. Eve has been infected by mutant cells that are slowly corrupting her body, so together with Jason and Fred, they board G-SOPHIA and begin an intergalactic journey to Eve's home planet, Sophia, in hopes of finding a cure for the mutant infection.
&nbsp;
A perfect blend of action-adventure through outer space and the signature Blaster Master gameplay creates a formula for a fun new experience.
&nbsp;
●G-SOPHIA's Gaea System is the key to maximum mutant blasting efficiency!
The Gaea System converts the energy created by the impact of falling from tall heights or taking damage, then turns that energy into SP. By making good use of the terrain, more and more SP can be recovered, allowing Jason to use more of G-SOPHIA's sub-weapons.
Mastering the Gaia System brings out G-SOPHIA's full potential, allowing players to traverse stages in an ultra-satisfying way.
&nbsp;
●Get familiar with Jason's new technique, the BLAST COUNTER.
Jason's got a new trick up his sleeve! In top-down view stages, Jason can initiate a BLAST COUNTER at the moment an enemy makes an attack, allowing him to deliver a powerful counterattack.
Getting a feel for BLAST COUNTERS allows you to dish out lots of damage and make good use of your wide variety of gun levels and sub-weapons. This is the key to clearing top-down view stages with speed!
&nbsp;
●Power up G-SOPHIA and Jason as you travel across the galaxy!
Search high and low across the planets you visit to find hidden maps for small planetoids in their orbit. Explore a wide variety of planetoids and find upgrades for G-SOPHIA and Jason.
&nbsp;
●A whole new group of Metal Attackers with their own pilots and support droids takes the stage!
Throughout his journey, Jason crosses paths with a motley cast of Metal Attacker battle-tank pilots and their respective support droids. Sometimes they're friend, sometimes they're foe.

- Want to try your hand at haggling? See if you can strike a deal with each of the sellers you meet! Every character features immersive voice acting to help you feel like you're really there!
- Inspect items to discover any damage or special features they might be hiding... but don't get too eager, or you might tick off the vendor and blow the whole deal!
- When you're ready to see just how much your finds are worth, head down to the salerooms for nailbiting auction action! You'll hear and see the auctioneer selling off your loot to the highest bidder, hopefully bringing you in a tidy profit... but watch out, it could also be a crashing loss!
- Don't expect the auction house to go easy on you, though! If you bring in junk, the valuer will toss it back at you!
- Mess up too many times, and you'll soon be swamped with bills piling high... bankruptcy lurks just around the corner!
- But get it right and you'll be raking in the profits, improving your home, upgrading your car and buying ever more expensive rarities before you know it!
